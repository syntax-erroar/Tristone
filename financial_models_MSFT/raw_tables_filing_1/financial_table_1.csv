• A material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing
devices. We and our competitors continue to devote significant resources to developing and deploying
"cloud-based strategies and services for consumers and business customers, and pricing and delivery"
models are evolving.
• We are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI
capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. AI technology and services are a highly competitive
"and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant"
"development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, and"
infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be
"responsive to technological change, new and potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny."
"• Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business"
"models, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software"
revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in
"research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products."
Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.
"• Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by"
selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these
"competitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products."
• Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost
"to end users, developing, making available, or using AI models that are open, and earning revenue on"
advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and
development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality
of our products.
"mpetitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased"
"ng costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which could adversely affect"
ncial condition and results of operations.

• Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI services and products that generate increasing
traffic and market share.
"• Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI services on the growing"
"array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices."
• Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
• Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our
customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.
