Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; • Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and • Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Freeport- McMoRan Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 15, 2024 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We obtained and assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and, as applicable, third-party tax or legal opinions or other external correspondence and analyses. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Notes 11 and 12 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental Obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $1.9 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging because significant judgment is required by the Company to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, the duration and effectiveness of the chosen remedial strategy, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties.

============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s measurement of the environmental loss contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental loss contingency calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingencies. To test the Company’s measurement of the environmental loss contingencies, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the Company’s analyses and tested the significant assumptions discussed above. We utilized our environmental professionals to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50% of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2023, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 %-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Note 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. FMC’s unincorporated joint venture at Morenci is reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies over which FCX has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method and include PT-FI’s investment in PT Smelting (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20%, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include mineral reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income (expense), net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains totaled $20 million in 2023, $9 million in 2022 and $66 million in 2021. Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. FCX’s restricted cash and cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks in accordance with Indonesia regulations, assurance bonds to support PT-FI’s commitment for smelter development in Indonesia, and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure obligations. Refer to Notes 12 and 14 for further information. Inventories. Inventories include product, materials and supplies, and mill and leach stockpiles. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW), refining, roasting and chemical processing. Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., SX/EW). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Each mine site maintains one work-in-process balance on a weighted-average cost basis for each process (i.e. , leach, mill or concentrate leach) regardless of the number of stockpile systems at that site. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 % depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 % of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Process rates and copper recoveries for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery estimates are adjusted annually based on new information and as related technology and processing methods change. Recovery adjustments will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. For example, an increase in recovery rates increases recoverable copper in the leach stockpiles resulting in a lower weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper and a decrease in recovery rates decreases recoverable copper in the leach stockpiles and results in a higher weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper . Based on the annual review of mill and leach stockpiles, FCX increased its estimated recoverable copper in certain leach stockpiles, net of joint venture interests, by 73 million pounds in 2023 and 223 million pounds in 2022. These revised estimates did not have a material impact on the weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper or FCX’s consolidated site production and delivery costs in 2023 or 2022. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable mineral reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the underground mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and included as a component of production and delivery costs. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of production and delivery costs. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) measured and indicated mineral resources that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. AROs associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to production and delivery costs. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in production and delivery costs. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the Platts Metals Daily Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs using the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders (after deducting undistributed dividends and earnings allocated to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be antidilutive. Reconciliations of net income and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2023 2022 2021 Net income $3,751 $4,479 $5,365 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,903) (1,011) (1,059) Undistributed dividends and earnings allocated to participating securities (6) (7) (7) Net income attributable to common stockholders $1,842 $3,461 $4,299 (shares in millions) Basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,434 1,441 1,466 Add shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of dilutive stock options and RSUs 9 10 16 Diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,443 1,451 1,482 Net income per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $1.28 $2.40 $2.93 Diluted $1.28 $2.39 $2.90
============================================================

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock. Excluded shares of common stock associated with outstanding stock options totaled less than 1 million shares in 2023, 1 million shares in 2022 and 5 million shares in 2021. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. New Accounting Standards. Following is a discussion of new accounting standards. Segment Reporting. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to segment reporting that requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment. This ASU becomes effective for annual periods beginning in 2024 and interim periods in 2025. FCX does not expect the new ASU to have a significant impact on its current segment reporting as presented within Note 16. Income Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU requiring enhancements to disclosures related to income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. This ASU becomes effective January 1, 2025. FCX is assessing the impact of this ASU, and upon adoption, may be required to include certain additional disclosures in the notes to its financial statements. Subsequent Events. FCX evaluated events after December 31, 2023, and through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS Cobalt Business. In September 2021, FCX’s 56 % owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited (KCHL), completed the sale of its remaining cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (Freeport Cobalt) to Jervois Global Limited (Jervois) for $208 million (before post-closing adjustments), consisting of cash consideration of $173 million and 7 % of Jervois common stock (valued at $35 million at the time of closing). In 2022, KCHL sold these shares for $60 million. At closing, Freeport Cobalt’s assets included cash of approximately $20 million and other net assets of $125 million. In 2021, FCX recorded a gain of $60 million ($34 million to net income attributable to common stock) associated with this transaction. In addition, KCHL has the right to receive contingent consideration through 2026 of up to $40 million based on the future performance of Freeport Cobalt. Any gain related to the contingent consideration will be recognized when received. Following this transaction, FCX no longer has cobalt operations. PT Smelting. In April 2021, PT-FI acquired 14.5 % of the outstanding common stock of PT Smelting, a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia, for $33 million, increasing its ownership interest from 25.0 % to 39.5 %. The remaining outstanding shares of PT Smelting are owned by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC). PT-FI accounts for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and molybdenum from mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2023, FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FMC has a 72 % interest in Morenci (refer to “Joint Ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100 % of the other North America mines. At December 31, 2023, operating mines in South America were Cerro Verde (53.56 % owned) located in Peru and El Abra (51 % owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 2023, FMC’s net assets totaled $17.8 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $13.3 billion. FCX had no loans to FMC outstanding at December 31, 2023. FCX owns 48.76 % of PT-FI (refer to “PT-FI Divestment”). At December 31, 2023, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $15.5 billion and its retained earnings totaled $11.0 billion. FCX had no loans to PT-FI outstanding at December 31, 2023. FCX owns 100 % of the outstanding Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain) common stock. At December 31, 2023, Atlantic Copper’s net assets totaled $97 million and its accumulated deficit totaled $443 million. FCX had $611 million in loans to Atlantic Copper outstanding at December 31, 2023. PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 Transaction). Pursuant to the divestment agreement and related documents, PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired all of Rio Tinto plc’s (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 % of FCX’s interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI). In connection with the 2018 Transaction, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of PT Rio Tinto Indonesia that held the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture interest. After the 2018 Transaction, MIND ID’s (26.24 %) and PTI’s (25.00 %) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 % and FCX’s share ownership totals 48.76 %. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , MIND ID) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI approximated 81 % through 2022 and is 48.76 % in 2023 and thereafter (see “Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss” below). FCX, PT-FI, PTI and MIND ID entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether MIND ID has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the 2018 Transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders retained the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the 2018 Transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement included in the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitled FCX to approximately 81 % of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining 19 % paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI’s cumulative net income during the Initial Period totaled $6.0 billion, of which $4.9 billion was attributed to FCX. In addition, because PT-FI did not achieve the Gold Target (as defined in the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement) during the Initial Period, PT-FI’s net income and cash dividends associated with the sale of approximately 190,000 ounces of gold during 2023 were attributed approximately 81 % to FCX and 19 % to MIND ID. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss is based on equity ownership percentages (48.76 % for FCX, 26.24 % for MIND ID and 25.00 % for PTI), except for net income of $35 million that was attributable to the approximately 190,000 ounces of gold sales discussed above. For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Joint Ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. FMC owns a 72 % undivided interest in Morenci via an unincorporated joint venture. The remaining 28 % is owned by Sumitomo (15 %) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13 %). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. FMC purchased 46 million pounds during 2023 and 62 million pounds during 2022 of Morenci’s copper cathode from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. at market prices for $177 million and $245 million, respectively. FMC had receivables from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. totaling $17 million at December 31, 2023, and $25 million at December 31, 2022. PT Smelting. PT Smelting is an Indonesia company that owns a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. In 1996, PT-FI entered into a joint venture and shareholder agreement with MMC to jointly construct the PT Smelting facilities. PT Smelting, which commenced operations in 1999, was the first operating copper smelter facility in Indonesia. PT-FI owns 39.5 % of the outstanding common stock of PT Smelting. MMC owns the remaining 60.5 % of PT Smelting’s outstanding common stock and serves as the operator of the facilities. On November 30, 2021, PT-FI entered into a convertible loan agreement to fund an expansion of PT Smelting’s facilities. In December 2023, the project was completed and PT-FI’s loan is expected to convert into PT Smelting equity in 2024, increasing PT-FI’s ownership in PT Smelting to approximately 65%. FCX has determined that PT Smelting is a variable interest entity (VIE), however, as mutual consent of both PT-FI and MMC is required to make the decisions that most significantly impact the economic performance of PT Smelting, PT-FI is not the primary beneficiary. As PT-FI has the ability to exercise significant influence over PT Smelting, it accounts for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method (refer to Note 6). PT-FI’s maximum exposure to loss is its investment in PT Smelting and its loan to fund the expansion (refer to Note 6). PT-FI’s equity in PT Smelting’s earnings totaled $10 million in 2023, $24 million in 2022 and $6 million in 2021. Beginning January 1, 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement. Under this arrangement, PT-FI pays PT Smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its copper concentrate and PT-FI retains title to all products for sale to third parties (i.e. , there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting). While the new tolling agreement with PT Smelting does not significantly change PT-FI’s economics, it impacts the timing of PT-FI’s sales and working capital requirements. NOTE 4. INVENTORIES, INCLUDING LONG-TERM MILL AND LEACH STOCKPILES The components of inventories follow:

============================================================

a. Refer to Note 7 for current portion. b. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering some U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. In August 2020, the FMC Retirement Plan, the largest FMC plan, was amended such that, effective September 1, 2020, participants no longer accrue any additional benefits. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s primary investment objectives for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) are to maintain funds sufficient to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due, minimize the volatility of the plan’s funded status to the extent practical, and to maintain prudent levels of risk consistent with the plan’s investment policy. The FMC plan assets are invested in a risk-mitigating portfolio, which is allocated among multiple fixed income managers. The current target allocation of the portfolio is long-duration credit (50 %); long-duration U.S. government/credit (20 %); core fixed income (16 %); long-term U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (13 %); and cash equivalents (1 %). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 5.75 % per annum beginning January 1, 2024, which is based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments together with the Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean. The Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum. The participant has elected to receive an equivalent lump sum payment. The payment will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 15,339 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2023, and 15,652 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2022. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum severance to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7 % per annum beginning January 1, 2024. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for qualified and non-qualified plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

a. Employer contributions for 2024 are currently expected to approximate $65 million for the FCX plans and $11 million for the PT-FI plan (based on a December 31, 2023, exchange rate of 15,339 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar). During 2023, the actuarial loss of $15 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 5.41 % to 5.15 % . During 2022, the actuarial gain of $623 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 2.85 % to 5.41 %.

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to prices derived using significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to prices derived using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories included in the above tables and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds primarily require up to a two-business-day notice for redemptions. Fixed income investments include corporate and government bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

============================================================

a. Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits. Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

a. Based on a December 31, 2023, exchange rate of 15,339 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar. Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $5 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $34 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2023, and a current portion of $6 million and a long-term portion of $43 million at December 31, 2022. FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $46 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2023, and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $41 million at December 31, 2022. FCX also sponsors a retirement savings plan for most of its U.S. employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with specified guidelines. The savings plan is a qualified 401(k) plan for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. Participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options under the plan. FCX contributes to the plan and matches a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides a nonqualified unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $62 million at December 31, 2023, and $56 million at December 31, 2022, all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for the employee savings plan totaled $119 million in 2023, $101 million in 2022 and $95 million in 2021. FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Financial Policy. In February 2021, FCX’s Board of Directors (Board) adopted a financial policy for the allocation of cash flows aligned with FCX’s strategic objectives of maintaining a strong balance sheet, providing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. The policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50% of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interests would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to FCX maintaining its net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion (excluding net project debt for the Indonesia smelter projects). The Board reviews the structure of the performance-based payout framework at least annually. In February 2021, the Board reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock (base dividend), and on November 1, 2021, the Board approved (i) a variable cash dividend on FCX’s common stock and (ii) a new share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $3.0 billion of FCX common stock. In July 2022, the Board authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from up to $3.0 billion to up to $5.0 billion. Under its share repurchase program, FCX acquired 12.74 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $0.5 billion ($38.32 average cost per share) in 2021 and 35.12 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $1.3 billion ($38.36 average cost per share) in 2022. There were no shares acquired under the program in 2023. As of February 15, 2024, FCX has $3.2 billion available for repurchases under the program. On December 20, 2023, FCX declared quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on its common stock (including a $0.075 per share base dividend and $0.075 per share variable dividend), which were paid on February 1, 2024, to common stockholders of record as of January 12, 2024. The declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) and timing and amount of any share repurchases are at the discretion of FCX’s Board and management, respectively, and are subject to a number of factors, including not exceeding FCX’s net debt target, capital availability, FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by FCX’s Board or management, as applicable. FCX’s share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the Board’s discretion. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

Stock Award Plans. FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2023, 20.5 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans. Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options vest in one-third annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The award agreements also provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. FCX did not grant stock options in 2023 or 2022. A summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2023, follows:

============================================================

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the expected annual dividend at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option.

a. FCX did not grant stock options in 2023 or 2022. Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Since 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after a three-year performance period. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.4 million for 2023 and 2022 and 0.3 million for 2021, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 % and 200 % of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) may be increased or decreased up to 25 % of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. PSU awards for FCX’s executive officers who are retirement-eligible are non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the non-forfeitable PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational metrics are established, which is typically grant date. The fair value of PSU awards for FCX’s executive officers who are not retirement-eligible are expensed over the performance period. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the awards vest. A summary of outstanding stock-settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2023, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2023, follows:

============================================================

The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs granted was $93 million during 2023, $83 million during 2022 and $62 million during 2021. The total intrinsic value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs vested was $136 million during 2023, $138 million during 2022 and $56 million during 2021. As of December 31, 2023, FCX had $27 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs and PSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.2 years. Cash-Settled RSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the awards vest.

The intrinsic value of cash-settled RSUs vested was $20 million during 2023, $26 million during 2022 and $24 million during 2021. The accrued liability associated with cash-settled RSUs consisted of a current portion of $19 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $7 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2023, and a current portion of $19 million and a long-term portion of $5 million at December 31, 2022.

============================================================

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2023, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.2 billion that will expire between 2024 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of $5.4 billion that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, of which $0.4 billion can be carried forward indefinitely, (iii) U.S. state NOLs of $10.4 billion that primarily expire between 2024 and 2043 and (iv) Atlantic Copper NOLs of $0.5 billion that can be carried forward indefinitely. Valuation Allowances. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2023, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2023, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits and U.S. federal NOLs, substantially all of its U.S. state and foreign NOLs, as well as a portion of its U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs totaled $1.8 billion and other deferred tax assets totaled $0.9 billion at December 31, 2023. NOLs and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or NOLs can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or NOLs that can be implemented. The $91 million net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2023 is primarily related to $32 million of U.S. federal NOLs utilized during 2023, and a $292 million decrease related to expirations of U.S. foreign tax credits, partially offset by an increase of $188 million, primarily associated with current year changes in U.S. federal temporary differences and a $22 million increase in valuation allowances against Section 163(j) deferred tax assets related to current year activity. U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 . The provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act) became applicable to FCX on January 1, 2023. The Act includes, among other provisions, a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) of 15 % on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. FCX has made interpretations of certain provisions of the Act, and based on these interpretations, determined that the provisions of the Act did not materially impact FCX’s financial results in 2023. Although the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) published guidance in 2023 that provided some additional clarity on these rules, uncertainty remains regarding the application of the CAMT. Future guidance released by the Treasury may differ from FCX’s interpretations of the Act, which could be material and may further limit FCX’s ability to realize future benefits from its U.S. NOLs. Indonesia Tax Matters. In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. In 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During fourth-quarter 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters as they relate to the audits for years 2012 through 2016. In 2021, PT-FI participated in discussions with the Indonesia Tax Office regarding progress on the framework for resolution. As a result of these discussions and the revised positions taken by both the Indonesia Tax Office and PT-FI, FCX could no longer conclude a resolution of all of the disputed tax items at a more-likely-than-not threshold and PT-FI recorded net charges of $384 million, including $155 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other income (expense), net, $43 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $186 million to provision for income tax expense. During 2022, in conjunction with the framework for resolution of disputed matters and the closure of the 2018 corporate income tax audit, PT-FI recorded net charges of $13 million, including $5 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $8 million to provision for income taxes. PT-FI continues to engage with the Indonesia Tax Office in pursuit of clarification on certain aspects of the original framework for resolution of the disputed matters. In 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of Government Regulation Number 50 of 2022, which stipulates that objection, tax court, and judicial review verdicts issued after the issuance of the harmonization law qualify for reduced penalties, PT-FI recorded net credits totaling $69 million, including a credit of $76 million recorded to other income (expense), net and a charge of $7 million to provision for income taxes. Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects it to a stable income tax rate of 32 % through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The enacted tax rate on dividend distributions, which is not stabilized by the agreement, is 5 %. Chile Tax Matters . In December 2023, the US-Chilean Tax Treaty was ratified and will enter into force in 2024. Ratification of this treaty results in the extension of FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to an income tax rate of 35 %. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023 mining royalty rates at El Abra were based on a sliding scale of 5 % to 14 % (depending on a defined operational margin). In August 2023, the Chile legislature approved a mining royalty tax reform package that took effect on January 1, 2024, under which the mining royalty taxes will consist of two main components (i) profitability based mining royalty rates on a sliding scale of 8 % to 26 % (depending on a defined operational margin) and (ii) an additional ad valorem royalty tax based on 1 % of sales. Uncertain Tax Positions. Tax positions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are, based on their technical merits, more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities or have otherwise been effectively settled. Such tax positions reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income (expense), net rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows.

============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $536 million at December 31, 2023, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with cost recovery methods and royalties and other related mining taxes, $551 million at December 31, 2022, and $620 million at December 31, 2021. Amounts include unpaid items on the consolidated balance sheet of $33 million at December 31, 2023, $36 million at December 31, 2022, and $41 million at December 31, 2021. Charges for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $153 million in 2023, $7 million in 2022 and $34 million in 2021. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $720 million at December 31, 2023, included $597 million ($421 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current and prior-year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX’s tax treatment of cost recovery methods and various non-deductible costs. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2024, FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX’s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2023, FCX had more than 80 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 22 U.S. states. The aggregate environmental obligation for approximately 50 % of the active remediation projects totaled approximately $20 million at December 31, 2023. A summary of changes in FCX’s estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis. b. Primarily reflects revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects. See further discussion below for charges recorded in 2023 associated with the Pinal Creek and Newtown Creek environmental matters. Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $4.5 billion, including $131 million in 2024, $147 million in 2025, $139 million in 2026, $128 million in 2027, $108 million in 2028 and $3.9 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2023, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.9 billion, including $1.8 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.9 billion and $5.0 billion on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis. At December 31, 2023, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2023. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. During 2023, FCX recorded adjustments to the Pinal Creek environmental obligation totaling $61 million associated with a refined engineering scope and cost estimate for work to be completed within the next several years. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $518 million at December 31, 2023. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984, a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrial uses on and around the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and four other companies (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) and the City of New York entered an Administrative Order on Consent to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify remedial options. EPA approved the final RI in April 2023. The NCG’s FS work and efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. The NCG expects to submit a draft FS report to EPA by October 2026 and currently expects EPA to select a creek-wide remedy in 2029, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. Further, in early 2022, EPA asked the NCG to develop and evaluate alternatives for an early action remediation project in the East Branch tributary of the creek. The NCG submitted to EPA a draft early action focused feasibility study relating to remediation options for the East Branch and EPA provided comments. During 2023, FCX recorded adjustments to Newtown Creek environmental obligations totaling $64 million based on updated cost estimates from such draft early action focused feasibility study. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $423 million at December 31, 2023. The final costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. Changes to the overall cost of this remedial obligation and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX established an environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation. Assessments of sediments in the adjacent Arthur Kill and possible remedial actions could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. FCX’s environmental liability balance for historical smelter sites, including in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey, was $262 million at December 31, 2023. During 2023, the Superior Court of New Jersey approved an agreement between the parties to settle all claims for an amount not material to FCX in a putative class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, that was filed on January 30, 2017, against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. Under the terms of the Consent Decree executed in May 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. The Consent Decree excluded 23 former uranium mine sites at which an FCX subsidiary may also be potentially liable, but for which the United States recovered funds as part of a larger bankruptcy settlement with Tronox. By letter dated September 29, 2021, EPA informed an FCX subsidiary as well as two other federal entities that it does not expect to have funds sufficient to remediate all of the sites covered by the Tronox bankruptcy settlement. Based on information from EPA, it is currently considered unlikely that EPA will deplete the Tronox settlement funds in the near-term. FCX is also conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on approximately 15,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. A similar agreement is in place with the U.S. Forest Service for mine features on U.S. Forest Service land. Either BLM or the U.S. Forest Service may request additional assessment or remediation activities for other claims with mining features. FCX will update this obligation when it has a sufficient number of remedy decisions from the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service to support a reasonably certain range of outcomes. FCX expects it will take several years to complete this work. FCX’s environmental liability balance for the uranium mining sites was $444 million at December 31, 2023. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

a. Primarily reflects adjustments at PT-FI, Morenci and Bagdad for the year 2022 and PT-FI for the year 2021, see further discussion below. b. Includes a $112 million adjustment at PT-FI to correct certain inputs in the historical PT-FI ARO model. ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. For ARO activities and expenditures for oil and gas operations, the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2023, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1.1 billion was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2023, FCX had trust assets totaling $0.2 billion (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for their oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $0.5 billion. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. The agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments and completed a permit renewal for Chino in 2020 and Tyrone in 2021. At December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $522 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the ADEQ. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards during operations and closure. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the implementation cost, with a more detailed closure plan required at the time operations cease. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. Closure costs for facilities covered by APPs are required to be updated every six years and financial assurance mechanisms are required to be updated every two years. During 2022, the Morenci and Bagdad mines increased their AROs by $118 million and $65 million, respectively, associated with their updated closure strategies and plans for stockpiles and tailings impoundments that were submitted to ADEQ for approval. In accordance with FCX’s commitment to the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, Sierrita expects to revise its closure plan and cost estimate in 2024, which could result in a significant change in estimate. FCX will continue evaluating and, as necessary, updating its closure plans and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites, and any such updates may also result in increased costs that could be significant. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. In fourth-quarter 2023, the Arizona State Mines Inspector requested updates to reclamation cost estimates and associated financial assurance for FCX’s Arizona mine sites. FCX’s responses to their requests and the posting of updated financial assurance will not be completed until mid-2024; FCX’s expectation is that these updates, in the aggregate, will not be material. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $607 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. In 2020, the Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) approved Henderson’s proposed update to its closure plan and closure cost estimate. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. In accordance with its permit from DRMS, Climax expects to submit an updated reclamation plan and cost estimate in April 2024, which could result in a significant change in estimate. As of December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $171 million for its Colorado operations. Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Chile Mining and Geology Agency. El Abra submitted an updated closure plan and cost estimates in November 2018, and approval of the updated closure plan and cost estimates was received in August 2020. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, El Abra expects to submit an updated plan with closure cost estimates in 2025 unless a modification to the closure plan requires early submission. At December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $106 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM). Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in 2023, Cerro Verde submitted its updated closure plan and cost estimates and received approval from MINEM in December 2023. At December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $206 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities under the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. In 2021, the construction time frame for reclamation of the West Wanagon overburden stockpile was extended from 2025 to 2029 because safety constraints for working in steep and difficult terrain have reduced labor and equipment operating efficiencies. The time frame extension resulted in longer and escalating fixed costs, combined with additional anticipated volumes of stockpile material to be moved, which resulted in ARO adjustments totaling $397 million in 2021 (of which $340 million related to the depleted Grasberg open pit and was charged to production and delivery costs). In 2022, estimated costs associated with West Wanagon slope stabilization remediation and reclamation activities increased primarily as a result of increased material needed for stockpile stabilization and increased costs for equipment, operations and maintenance, increased manpower/headcount allocation and contractor/consultant cost impacts, which resulted in ARO adjustments totaling $131 million in 2022 (of which $116 million related to the depleted Grasberg open pit and was charged to production and delivery costs). At December 31, 2023, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $958 million for its PT-FI operations. Indonesia government regulations issued in 2010 require a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. At December 31, 2023, PT-FI had restricted time deposits totaling $97 million for mine closure included in other assets. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2023, ARO adjustments associated with oil and gas properties totaled $91 million, which reflected abandoned wells and additional obligations assumed as a result of bankruptcies from other companies. As of December 31, 2023, FM O&G AROs cover 115 wells and approximately 130 platforms and other structures and it had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $391 million. Litigation. In addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and above under “Environmental,” we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. SEC regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any current pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in 13 cases filed in 2013 and thereafter in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulfur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. In 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all 13 cases, and as of October 2022, all parties have executed the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. Under the terms of the agreement, FCX agreed it will pay $15 million in trust to later be deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) if the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund within three years of execution of the settlement agreement. Upon payment of the $15 million, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all 13 pending cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be $23.5 million, including the initial $15 million payment. The settlement agreement terms will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of $4.25 million provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of such annual installments are conditioned on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, and all subsequent installments are conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, which is expected to offset the payments resulting in a $23.5 million maximum total payment obligation. On March 16, 2023, a non-plaintiff coastal parish included in the settlement (Terrebonne), filed an amended petition titled Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government vs. Louisiana Department of Natural Resources et al. , Docket No. 185576, in the 32nd Judicial District Court, Terrebonne Parish, State of Louisiana, adding the settling FCX affiliates to a lawsuit that challenges whether Terrebonne Parish is validly bound to the settlement agreement and seeks to have the court declare the settlement void. FCX is vigorously defending this matter. Asbestos and Talc Claims . Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining and processing from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. In accordance with the terms of the 1992 transactions and subsequent agreements, Imerys undertook the defense and indemnification of Cyprus Mines and CAMC in talc lawsuits. Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations and took responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, in February 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys stopped defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys took the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access could be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently on hold. The bankruptcy court continues to temporarily stay approximately 950 talc lawsuits against CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX and Imerys but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will continue to impose the interim stay. In January 2021, Imerys filed the form of a settlement and release agreement to be entered into by CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX, Imerys and the other debtors, tort claimants’ committee and future claims representative in the Imerys bankruptcy. In accordance with the global settlement, among other things, (1) CAMC agreed to contribute a total of $130 million in cash to a settlement trust in seven annual installments, which will be guaranteed by FCX, and (2) CAMC and Cyprus Mines and their affiliates will contribute to the settlement trust all rights that they have to the proceeds of certain legacy insurance policies as well as indemnity rights they have against Johnson & Johnson. Mediation to resolve open issues is complete, but the parties remain in the process of finalizing approval of the amended global settlement, which would increase the contribution from CAMC by $65 million, to $195 million. The payment terms from the initial settlement are unchanged. The global settlement continues to be subject to, among other things, votes by claimants in both the Imerys and Cyprus Mines bankruptcy cases as well as bankruptcy court approvals in both cases, and there can be no assurance that the global settlement will be approved and successfully implemented. At December 31, 2023, FCX had a litigation reserve of $195 million associated with the proposed settlement (representing charges recorded to environmental obligations and shutdown costs of $65 million in 2023 and $130 million in 2020). Tax Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT (National Superintendency of Customs and Administration) assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period from December 2006 to December 2013. Cerro Verde contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. During 2021, Cerro Verde paid the balance of the disputed royalty assessments and has no remaining exposure associated with the royalty dispute with the Peruvian tax authorities. No royalty assessments were issued for the years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15-year stability agreement. In 2020, FCX filed on its own behalf and on behalf of Cerro Verde, international arbitration proceedings against the Peruvian government under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The hearing on the merits took place in May 2023 and closing arguments occurred in July 2023. In 2020, SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. (SMM Cerro Verde), another shareholder of Cerro Verde, filed parallel international arbitration proceedings against the Peruvian government under the Netherlands-Peru Bilateral Investment Treaty. SMM Cerro Verde’s hearing on the merits and closing arguments took place in February 2023 and the parties are awaiting decisions from both arbitration proceedings. No amounts have been recorded for potential gain contingencies associated with the international arbitration proceedings. Other Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalties and Interest Total 2003 to 2008 $47 $130 $177 2009 56 52 108 2010 54 126 180 2011 and 2012 42 77 119 2013 48 72 120 2014 to 2022 81 35 116 $328 $492 $820
============================================================

As of December 31, 2023, Cerro Verde had paid the $820 million of disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $546 million, resulting in a net receivable of $274 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. Cerro Verde’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $712 million at December 31, 2023, of which $242 million has not been charged to expense. Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================

As of December 31, 2023, PT-FI had paid $189 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $179 million, resulting in a net receivable of $10 million (included in other assets), which PT-FI believes is collectible. PT-FI’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $301 million at December 31, 2023, of which $117 million has not been charged to expense. Withholding Tax Assessments . In 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court rendered an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in 2017. PT-FI currently has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the years 2005 and 2007, which total $43 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023), including penalties and interest. Indonesia Regulatory Matters. Export Licenses . In June 2023, export licenses for several exporters, including PT-FI and PT Smelting, expired. In addition, a change in regulations during 2023 required PT-FI to follow a new administrative process for the export of anode slimes. During 2023, the Indonesia government issued various regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including regulations by Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) to allow continued exports of copper concentrates through May 2024 for companies engaged in ongoing smelter development projects with construction progress greater than 50 %, and regulations by the Ministry of Trade on the permitted export of various products, including copper concentrates. In July 2023, PT-FI was granted an export license for copper concentrate and in December 2023, PT-FI was granted an export license for anode slimes, which are valid through May 2024. PT-FI and the Indonesia government are completing administrative processes to update quotas for estimated concentrate and anode slimes exports through May 2024. PT-FI is working with the Indonesia government to obtain approvals to continue exports of copper concentrates and anode slimes subsequent to May 2024 until the Indonesia smelter projects are fully commissioned and reach designed operating conditions. Export Duties . Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of export duties. Smelter Development Progress . In January 2021, the Indonesia government levied an administrative fine of $149 million for the period from March 30, 2020, through September 30, 2020, against PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on its Manyar smelter as of July 31, 2020. In January 2021, PT-FI responded to the Indonesia government by objecting to the fine because of events outside of its control causing a delay of the Manyar smelter’s development progress. PT-FI believes that its communications during 2020 with the Indonesia government were not properly considered before the administrative fine was levied. In June 2021, the MEMR issued a ministerial decree for the calculation of an administrative fine for lack of smelter development in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, PT-FI recorded charges totaling $16 million for a potential settlement of the administrative fine. In January 2022, the Indonesia government submitted a new estimate of the administrative fine totaling $57 million, and in March 2022, PT-FI paid the administrative fine and recorded an additional charge of $41 million. In May 2023, the MEMR issued a new decree prescribing a revised formula for administrative fines for delays in construction of smelting and refining facilities, taking into account allowances for certain delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as verified by a third-party. In mid-July 2023, PT-FI submitted its third-party verified calculation, which resulted in an accrual for a potential administrative fine of $55 million based on the formula prescribed by the decree related to the period from August 2020 through January 2022. PT-FI continues to discuss the applicability of this administrative fine with MEMR. Based on PT-FI’s revised smelter construction schedule, which was accepted by the Indonesia government in connection with the renewal of PT-FI’s export license in early 2022, PT-FI does not believe any additional fines should be assessed under the decree. Smelter Assurance . The decree issued by MEMR in May 2023 also required assurance in the form of an escrow account, which can be withdrawn if smelter development progress is at least 90 % on June 10, 2024. During 2023, PT-FI deposited $10 million in a joint account with the Indonesia government while it continues to discuss the applicability of the May 2023 decree. At December 31, 2023, development progress of the Indonesia smelter projects was 90.5 % (refer to Note 13); as such, PT-FI does not believe additional deposits are necessary. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of PT-FI’s assurance bonds to support its commitment for smelter development in Indonesia. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $353 million at December 31, 2023, primarily associated with reclamation/AROs, copper concentrate shipments from PT-FI to Atlantic Copper as required by Indonesia regulations, and disputed export duties (refer to Note 13 for discussion). In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $497 million at December 31, 2023, primarily associated with environmental obligations and AROs. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2023, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $58 million, which consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $47 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $20 million (a current portion of $6 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $14 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers.

Refer to Note 3 for additional discussion of PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting. FCX acquired right-of-use assets through lease arrangements of $167 million in 2023, $76 million in 2022 and $176 million in 2021. FCX payments included in operating cash flows for its lease liabilities totaled $61 million in 2023, $41 million in 2022 and $54 million in 2021. FCX payments included in financing cash flows for its lease liabilities totaled $3 million in 2023, $7 million in 2022 and $25 million in 2021. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities was 4.7 % (4.1 % as of December 31, 2022) and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 13.1 years (12.0 years as of December 31, 2022).

Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2023, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $4.2 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($3.3 billion), transportation services ($0.3 billion) and electricity ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Transportation obligations are primarily associated with contracted ocean freight agreements for our South America and Indonesia operations. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations total $2.2 billion in 2024, $1.3 billion in 2025, $0.3 billion in 2026, $0.1 billion in 2027, $0.1 billion in 2028 and $0.2 billion thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. IUPK – Indonesia. In December 2018, FCX completed the 2018 Transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the 2018 Transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI a special mining license (IUPK) to replace its former Contract of Work, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI was granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the development of additional smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government (refer to Note 12). The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041, assuming the additional extension is received. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 % corporate income tax rate, a 10 % profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 % for copper, 3.75 % for gold and 3.25 % for silver. PT-FI’s royalties charged against revenues totaled $338 million in 2023, $357 million in 2022 and $319 million in 2021. Dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX totaled $0.4 billion in 2023, $2.5 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021, and are subject to a 10% withholding tax. Export Duties . The IUPK required PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 %, declining to 2.5 % when smelter development progress exceeded 30 % and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia exceeded 50 %. In December 2022, PT-FI received approval, based on construction progress achieved, for a reduction in export duties from 5 % to 2.5 %, which was effective immediately. In March 2023, the Indonesia government further verified that construction progress of the Manyar smelter exceeded 50 % and PT-FI’s export duties were eliminated effective March 29, 2023. In July 2023, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised regulation on duties for various exported products, including copper concentrates. Under the revised regulation PT-FI was assessed export duties for copper concentrates at 7.5 % in the second half of 2023 (totaling $307 million). For 2024, the revised regulation assesses export duties for copper concentrates at 10 % for companies with smelter progress of 70 % to 90 % and at 7.5 % for companies with smelter progress exceeding 90 %. As of December 31, 2023, construction progress of the Indonesia smelter projects exceeded 90 %; however, PT-FI is subject to the 10 % export duty in 2024 until it receives a revised concentrate export license (after which PT-FI expects to be subject to the 7.5 % export duty). PT-FI’s export duties totaled $324 million in 2023, $307 million in 2022 and $218 million in 2021. PT-FI also continues to discuss the applicability of the revised regulation with the Indonesia government because of inconsistencies with its IUPK. Chiyoda Contract . In July 2021, PT-FI awarded a construction contract to Chiyoda for the construction of the Manyar smelter in Gresik, Indonesia with an estimated contract cost of $2.8 billion. The smelter is expected to be commissioned during 2024. Indemnification. The PT-FI divestment agreement, discussed in Note 3, provides that FCX will indemnify MIND ID and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to MIND ID in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. FCX had accrued $75 million as of December 31, 2023, and $74 million as of December 31, 2022, (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) related to this indemnification. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working and engagement relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide FCX’s practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, health, training, and cultural programs. PT-FI provides funding and technical assistance to support various community development programs in areas such as health, education, economic development and local infrastructure. In 1996, PT-FI established a social investment fund with the aim of contributing to social and economic development in the Mimika Regency. Prior to 2019, the fund was mainly managed by the Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Organization, a community-led institution. In 2019, a new foundation, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Empowerment Foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK) was established, and in 2020, PT-FI appointed YPMAK to assist in distributing a significant portion of PT-FI’s funding to support the development and empowerment of the local indigenous Papuan people. YPMAK is governed by a Board of Governors consisting of seven representatives, including four from PT-FI. In addition, since 2001, PT-FI has voluntarily established and contributed to land rights trust funds administered by Amungme and Kamoro representatives that focus on socioeconomic initiatives, human rights and environmental issues. PT-FI is committed to the continued funding of YPMAK programs and the land rights trust funds, as well as for other local-community development initiatives through 2041 and has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health, education and local economic development. PT-FI recorded charges totaling $123 million in both 2023 and 2022 and $109 million in 2021 to production and delivery costs for social and economic development programs. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod and cathode customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness during the three years ended December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 78 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.85 per pound, with maturities through November 2025. Summary of Gains (Losses). A summary of realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and the London gold price as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate, cathode or anode slimes at the then-current LME copper, COMEX copper or London gold prices. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate, cathode and anode slime sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2023, follows:

============================================================

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in production and delivery costs. At December 31, 2023, Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for 31 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.82 per pound, with maturities through February 2024. Summary of Gains (Losses). A summary of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized in operating income for commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedge transactions, including embedded derivatives, for the years ended December 31 follows:

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances. A summary of these net unsettled commodity contracts in the balance sheet follows (there were no offsetting amounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022):

============================================================

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $80 million. Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted trust assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, dividends payable and debt. The carrying value for these financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2023, FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values). Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows:

Includes (i) $1.1 billion associated with 30% of PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks for 90 days in accordance with a 2023 regulation issued by the Indonesia government and (ii) $145 million in assurance bonds to support PT-FI’s commitment for smelter development in Indonesia. The terms for $135 million of the assurance bonds have been fulfilled, and in August 2023, PT-FI submitted a request to MEMR for their release. NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2023. FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

a. Current portion included in other current assets and long-term portion included in other assets . b. Excludes amounts included in restricted cash and cash equivalents and other assets (which approximated fair value), primarily associated with (i) PT-FI’s export proceeds ($1.1 billion at December 31, 2023), (ii) assurance bonds to support PT-FI’s commitment for additional smelter development in Indonesia ($145 million at December 31, 2023, and $133 million at December 31, 2022) and (iii) PT-FI’s mine closure and reclamation guarantees ($97 million at December 31, 2023, and $103 million at December 31, 2022). c. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion and balance sheet classifications. d. Recorded at cost except for debt assumed in acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value at the respective acquisition dates. Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government mortgage-backed securities, government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. In December 2016, FCX’s sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties included up to $150 million in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration is being received over time as future cash flows are realized from a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform, with the related payments commencing in 2018. The contingent consideration included in (i) other current assets totaled $12 million at December 31, 2023, and $20 million at December 31, 2022, and (ii) other assets totaled $38 million at December 31, 2023, and $47 million at December 31, 2022. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is primarily valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2023, as compared to those techniques used at December 31, 2022. A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

a. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer. Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 13 % of FCX’s consolidated revenues in 2022 and 14 % in 2021, and they are the only customer that accounted for 10% or more of FCX’s annual consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2023. Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations and Morenci’s joint venture partners totaling $1.4 billion in 2023, $1.7 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021. Consolidated revenues also include PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $27 million in 2023 (reflecting adjustments to prior period provisionally priced concentrate sales), $3.0 billion in 2022 and $3.1 billion in 2021 as well as sales to PT-FI’s partner in PT Smelting, MMC, totaling $2.0 billion in 2023, $0.6 billion in 2022 and $0.4 billion in 2021. As discussed in Note 3, beginning January 1, 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement, and there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting. Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2023, approximately 29 % of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 16 % was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2024 (including the collective bargaining agreement with PT-FI’s unions that is effective through March 2024) or that had expired as of December 31, 2023, and continue to be negotiated. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mining operations to Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining until final sales to third parties occur. FCX also deferred recognizing profit on 39.5 % of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting from April 30, 2021, to December, 31, 2022, and 25.0 % prior to April 30, 2021, until final sales to third parties occurred. As discussed in Note 3, beginning January 1, 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed and there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star), Bagdad, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. During 2023, the Morenci mine produced 43 % of FCX’s North America copper and 14 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production. South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. During 2023, the Cerro Verde mine produced 82 % of FCX’s South America copper and 23 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production. Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. During 2023, PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district produced 39 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production and 99 % of FCX’s consolidated gold production. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode and rod. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2023, Atlantic Copper purchased 3 % of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 17 % from FCX’s South America mining operations and 20 % from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items, which include the Miami smelter, Freeport Cobalt (until its sale in September 2021), molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, the Indonesia smelter projects, certain non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee and Tohono in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2023, have been prepared using industry accepted practice and conform to the disclosure requirements under Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. FCX’s proven and probable mineral reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry. Mineral reserves, as used in the reserve data presented here, mean an estimate of tonnage and grade of measured and indicated mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. Proven mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. To classify an estimate as a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must possess a high degree of confidence of tonnage, grade and quality. Probable mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of an indicated or, in some cases, a measured mineral resource. The qualified person’s level of confidence will be lower in determining a probable mineral reserve than it would be in determining a proven mineral reserve. To classify an estimate as a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person’s confidence must still be sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable considering reasonable investment and market assumptions. FCX’s mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2023, were determined using metals price assumptions of $3.00 per pound for copper, $1,500 per ounce for gold and $12 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, LME copper settlement prices averaged $4.02 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $1,846 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Platts Metals Daily averaged $19.62 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries, where applicable.

Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through 2041. As a result, PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Note 13 for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK). As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, PT-FI expects to mine 43 % of its proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at December 31, 2023, representing 47 % of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 49 % of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable gold reserves. c. Consolidated mineral reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves of 329 million ounces of silver, which were determined using $20 per ounce. d. Net equity interest mineral reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note 3 for further discussion of FCX’s ownership in subsidiaries). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves of 218 million ounces of silver.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; • Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and • Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 15, 2023 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluated third-party tax or legal opinions obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Notes 11 and 12 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $1.7 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging because significant judgment was required by the Company to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, the duration and effectiveness of the chosen remedial strategy, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s measurement of the environmental loss contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental loss contingency calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingencies. To test the Company’s measurement of the environmental loss contingencies, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s models and tested the significant assumptions discussed above along with the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We utilized our environmental professionals to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities.

Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20%, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income (expense), net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains totaled $9 million in 2022, $66 million in 2021 and $34 million in 2020. Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a greenfield smelter in Indonesia; and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds. Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Each mine site maintains one work-in-progress balance on a weighted-average cost basis for each process (i.e. , leach, mill or concentrate leach) regardless of the number of stockpile systems at that site. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 % depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 % of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Process rates and copper recoveries for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Recovery adjustments will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, SX/EW, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable mineral reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) measured and indicated mineral resources, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. AROs associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Platts Metals Daily price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders (after deducting undistributed dividends and earnings allocated to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be antidilutive. Reconciliations of net income and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2022 2021 2020 Net income $4,479 $5,365 $865 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,011) (1,059) (266) Undistributed dividends and earnings allocated to participating securities (7) (7) (3) Net income attributable to common stockholders $3,461 $4,299 $596 (shares in millions) Basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,441 1,466 1,453 Add shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of dilutive stock options and RSUs 10 16 8 Diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,451 1,482 1,461 Net income per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $2.40 $2.93 $0.41 Diluted $2.39 $2.90 $0.41
============================================================

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock. Excluded shares of common stock totaled 1 million shares in 2022, 5 million shares in 2021 and 31 million shares in 2020. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Subsequent Events. Since February 11, 2023, PT-FI’s operations have been temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides, which restricted access to infrastructure near its milling operations. Recovery activities are in progress to clear debris from the affected areas and PT-FI is in the process of gradually resuming operations. Operations are expected to be fully restored by the end of February 2023. FCX evaluated events after December 31, 2022, and through the date the financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these financial statements. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS Cobalt Business. In September 2021, FCX’s 56 % owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited (KCHL), completed the sale of its remaining cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (Freeport Cobalt) to Jervois Global Limited (Jervois) for $208 million (before post-closing adjustments), consisting of cash consideration of $173 million and 7 % of Jervois common stock (valued at $35 million at the time of closing). In 2022, KCHL sold these shares for $60 million. At closing, Freeport Cobalt’s assets included cash of approximately $20 million and other net assets of $125 million. In 2021, FCX recorded a gain of $60 million ($34 million to net income attributable to common stock) associated with this transaction. In addition, KCHL has the right to receive contingent consideration through 2026 of up to $40 million based on the future performance of Freeport Cobalt. Any gain related to the contingent consideration will be recognized when received. Following this transaction, FCX no longer has cobalt operations. PT Smelting. On April 30, 2021, PT-FI acquired 14.5 % of the outstanding common stock of PT Smelting, a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia, for $33 million, increasing its ownership interest from 25.0 % to 39.5 %. The remaining outstanding shares of PT Smelting are owned by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC). PT-FI accounts for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Kisanfu Transaction. In December 2020, FCX completed the sale of its interests in the Kisanfu undeveloped copper and cobalt resource in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a wholly owned subsidiary of China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $550 million, with after-tax net cash proceeds totaling $415 million. FCX did not have any proven and probable mineral reserves associated with the Kisanfu project. FCX recorded a gain of $486 million in 2020 associated with this transaction. Timok Transactions. In 2016, FCX sold an interest in the upper zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia (the 2016 Transaction). In December 2019, FCX completed the sale of its interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project to an affiliate of the purchaser in the 2016 Transaction, which included the right to future contingent payments of up to $150 million. These future contingent payments will be based on the future sale of products (as defined in the agreement) from the Timok lower zone. For a period of 12 months after the third anniversary of the initial sale of products from the Timok lower zone, the purchaser can settle, or FCX can demand payment of, such deferred payment obligation, in each case, for a total of $60 million. As these deferred payments are contingent upon future production (the Timok lower zone project is still pre-operational) and would result in gain recognition, no amounts were recorded upon the closing of the transaction. Subsequent recognition will be based on the gain contingency model, in which the consideration would be recorded in the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. This is expected to be when FCX (i) is provided periodic product sales information by the purchaser or (ii) gives notice to the purchaser or receives notice from the purchaser regarding the settlement of the deferred payments for $60 million. In addition and in connection with the transaction in 2019, in lieu of payment upon achievement of defined development milestones provided for in the 2016 Transaction, the purchaser paid $107 million in three installments of $12 million in 2022, $50 million in 2021 and $45 million in 2020. TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its 70 % interest in TF Holdings Limited to CMOC for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash. In 2020, FCX realized and collected contingent consideration of $60 million and no additional amount is realizable. NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and molybdenum from mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2022, FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FMC has a 72 % interest in Morenci (refer to “Joint Venture. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100 % of the other North America mines. At December 31, 2022, operating mines in South America were Cerro Verde (53.56 % owned) located in Peru and El Abra (51 % owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 2022, FMC’s net assets totaled $19.0 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $12.2 billion. FCX had $1 million in loans to FMC outstanding at December 31, 2022. FCX owns 48.76 % of PT-FI (refer to “PT-FI Divestment”). At December 31, 2022, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $13.0 billion and its retained earnings totaled $8.4 billion. FCX had no loans to PT-FI outstanding at December 31, 2022. FCX owns 100 % of the outstanding Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain) common stock. At December 31, 2022, Atlantic Copper’s net assets totaled $104 million and its accumulated deficit totaled $440 million. FCX had $456 million in loans to Atlantic Copper outstanding at December 31, 2022. PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 Transaction). Pursuant to the divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum, also known as MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 % of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama). In connection with the 2018 Transaction, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of PT Rio Tinto Indonesia that held the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture interest. After the 2018 Transaction, MIND ID’s (26.24 %) and PTI’s (25.00 %) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 % and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 %. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , MIND ID) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI approximated 81 % through 2022 and is 48.76 % thereafter (see further discussion below). FCX, PT-FI, PTI and MIND ID entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether MIND ID has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the 2018 Transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the 2018 Transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement included in the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitled FCX to approximately 81 % of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining 19 % paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI’s cumulative net income during the Initial Period totaled $6.0 billion, of which $4.9 billion was attributed to FCX. In addition, because PT-FI did not achieve the Gold Target (as defined in the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement) during the Initial Period, PT-FI’s net income and cash dividends associated with the sale of approximately 190,000 ounces of gold in 2023 will be attributed approximately 81 % to FCX and 19 % to MIND ID. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss will be based on equity ownership percentages (48.76 % for FCX, 26.24 % for MIND ID and 25.00 % for PTI), except for the net income attributable to the approximately 190,000 ounces of gold sales discussed above. For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Joint Ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. FMC owns a 72 % undivided interest in Morenci via an unincorporated joint venture. The remaining 28 % is owned by Sumitomo (15 %) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13 %). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. FMC purchased 62 million pounds of Morenci’s copper cathode from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. at market prices for $245 million during 2022. FMC had receivables from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. totaling $25 million at December 31, 2022, and $20 million at December 31, 2021. PT Smelting. PT Smelting is an Indonesia company that owns a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. In 1996, PT-FI entered into a joint venture and shareholder agreement with MMC to jointly construct the PT Smelting facilities. PT Smelting, which commenced operations in 1999, was the first and currently the only operating copper smelter facility in Indonesia. PT-FI owns 39.5 % of the outstanding common stock of PT Smelting. MMC owns the remaining 60.5 % of PT Smelting’s outstanding common stock and serves as the operator of the facilities. On November 30, 2021, PT-FI entered into a convertible loan agreement to fund an expansion of PT Smelting’s facilities. Upon completion of the expansion project, targeted for year-end 2023, PT-FI’s loan is expected to convert into PT Smelting equity resulting in a majority ownership interest. FCX has determined that PT Smelting is a variable interest entity (VIE), however, as mutual consent of both PT-FI and MMC is required to make the decisions that most significantly impact the economic performance of PT Smelting, PT-FI is not the primary beneficiary. As PT-FI has the ability to exercise significant influence over PT Smelting, it accounts for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method (refer to Note 6). PT-FI’s maximum exposure to loss is its investment in PT Smelting and its loan to fund the expansion (refer to Note 6). Additionally, refer to Note 6 for the carrying values of PT-FI’s trade receivable balances from PT Smelting for sales of concentrate. PT-FI’s equity in PT Smelting’s earnings totaled $24 million in 2022, $6 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2020. Beginning in 2023, PT-FI's commercial arrangement with PT Smelting converted to a tolling arrangement. Under the arrangement, PT-FI pays PT Smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title to all products for sale to third parties (i.e., there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting).

============================================================

a. Materials and supplies inventory was net of obsolescence reserves totaling $39 million at December 31, 2022, and $36 million at December 31, 2021. b. Estimated metals in stockpiles not expected to be recovered within the next 12 months. FCX recorded metal inventory adjustments totaling $29 million in 2022, including $19 million associated with NRV adjustments related to lower market prices for copper and $10 million for stockpile write-offs at Cerro Verde; $16 million in 2021, primarily associated with stockpiles at the Morenci mine no longer expected to be leached; and $96 million in 2020 associated with NRV adjustments related to lower market prices for copper and molybdenum. Refer to Note 16 for metal inventory adjustments by business segment. El Abra Stockpile Adjustment . In 2022, the El Abra mine revised its estimated recovery rate assumptions for specific ore types expected to be processed from its existing leach stockpile. The revised estimates resulted in a 135 million pound reduction in future estimated recoverable copper from this leach stockpile, which is being phased out. This revised estimate did not have a significant impact on FCX’s consolidated site production and delivery costs in 2022. Morenci Stockpile Adjustments. The Morenci mine has experienced improved recoveries at certain of its leach stockpiles and following an analysis of column testing results in 2021, Morenci concluded it had sufficient evidence to increase its estimated recoveries for certain of its leach stockpiles. As a result of the revised recoveries, Morenci increased its estimated recoverable copper in leach stockpiles by 191 million pounds (net of joint venture interest). The effect of this change in estimate reduced FCX’s consolidated site production and delivery costs and increased net income by $112 million ($0.08 per share) in 2021. In 2022, based on an annual review of leach stockpiles, FCX increased its estimated recoverable copper in leach stockpiles at Morenci by 213 million pounds (net of joint venture interest). This revised estimate did not have a significant impact on FCX’s consolidated site production and delivery costs in 2022. NOTE 5.

a. Refer to Note 7 for current portion. b. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering some U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. In August 2020, the FMC Retirement Plan, the largest FMC plan, was amended such that, effective September 1, 2020, participants no longer accrue any additional benefits. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s primary investment objectives for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) are to maintain funds sufficient to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due, minimize the volatility of the plan’s funded status to the extent practical, and to maintain prudent levels of risk consistent with the plan’s investment policy. Historically, FMC plan assets have been invested in a balanced portfolio of return-seeking and risk-mitigating assets, with the allocation between these portfolios dependent on the funded status of the plan. During 2021, FCX reallocated essentially all of the portfolio to risk-mitigating assets with the objective of minimizing funded-status volatility. The risk-mitigating assets are allocated among multiple fixed income managers. The current target allocation of the portfolio is long-duration credit (50 %); long-duration U.S. government/credit (20 %); core fixed income (16 %); long-term U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS) (13 %); and cash equivalents (1 %). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 5 % per annum beginning January 1, 2023, which is based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments together with the Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum. The participant has elected to receive an equivalent lump sum payment. The payment will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 15,652 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2022, and 14,198 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2021. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum severance to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7 % per annum beginning January 1, 2023. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for qualified and non-qualified plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

a. Employer contributions for 2023 are currently expected to approximate $60 million for the FCX plans and $11 million for the PT-FI plan (based on a December 31, 2022, exchange rate of 15,652 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar). During 2022, the actuarial gain of $623 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 2.85 % to 5.41 % . During 2021, the actuarial gain of $117 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 2.50 % to 2.85 %.

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to prices derived using significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to prices derived using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories included in the above tables and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) primarily require up to a two-business-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Fixed income investments include corporate and government bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

a. Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits. Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

a. Based on a December 31, 2022, exchange rate of 15,652 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar. Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $6 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $43 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2022, and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $57 million at December 31, 2021. FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $41 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2022, and a current portion of $6 million and a long-term portion of $35 million at December 31, 2021. FCX also sponsors a retirement savings plan for most of its U.S. employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with specified guidelines. The savings plan is a qualified 401(k) plan for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. Participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options under the plan. FCX contributes to the plan and matches a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides a nonqualified unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $56 million at December 31, 2022, and $51 million at December 31, 2021, all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for the employee savings plan totaled $101 million in 2022, $95 million in 2021 and $40 million in 2020. The costs were lower in 2020, compared with 2022 and 2021, because of a temporary suspension of FCX contributions implemented as part of its April 2020 revised operating plans. FCX contributions resumed on January 1, 2021. FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Financial Policy. In February 2021, FCX’s Board of Directors (Board) adopted a financial policy for the allocation of cash flows aligned with FCX’s strategic objectives of maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash returns to shareholders while advancing opportunities for future growth. The policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50% of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interests would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to FCX maintaining its net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion (excluding project net debt for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia). In February 2021, the Board reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock (base dividend), and on November 1, 2021, the Board approved (i) a new share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $3.0 billion of FCX common stock and (ii) a variable cash dividend on FCX’s common stock for 2022. In July 2022, the Board authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from up to $3.0 billion to up to $5.0 billion. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (the Act), including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases beginning in 2023. In 2021, FCX acquired 12.74 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $0.5 billion ($38.32 average cost per share) and in 2022, FCX acquired 35.12 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program for a total cost of $1.3 billion ($38.36 average cost per share). As of February 15, 2023, FCX has $3.2 billion available for repurchases under the program. On December 21, 2022, FCX declared quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share ($0.075 per share base dividend and $0.075 per share variable dividend) on its common stock, which were paid on February 1, 2023, to common stockholders of record as of January 13, 2023. The declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) and timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of FCX’s Board and management, respectively, and is subject to a number of factors, including maintaining FCX’s net debt target, capital availability, FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by FCX’s Board or management, as applicable. FCX’s share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the Board’s discretion. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2022, 25.5 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans. Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options vest in one-third annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The award agreements also provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. There were no stock options granted by FCX in 2022. A summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2022, follows:

============================================================

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the expected annual dividend at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. Information related to stock options during the years ended December 31 follows:

a. FCX did not grant stock options in 2022. Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Since 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after a three-year performance period. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.4 million for 2022, 0.3 million for 2021 and 0.8 million for 2020, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 % and 200 % of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) may be increased or decreased up to 25 % of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. PSU awards for FCX's executive officers who are retirement-eligible are non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the non-forfeitable PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational metrics are established, which is typically grant date. The fair value of PSU awards for FCX's executive officers who are not retirement-eligible are expensed over the performance period. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the awards vest. A summary of outstanding stock-settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2022, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2022, follows:

The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs granted was $83 million during 2022, $62 million during 2021 and $47 million during 2020. The total intrinsic value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs vested was $138 million during 2022, $56 million during 2021 and $18 million during 2020. As of December 31, 2022, FCX had $25 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs and PSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.2 years. Cash-Settled RSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the awards vest.

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2022, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.5 billion that will expire between 2023 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal NOLs of $5.5 billion that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, of which $0.4 billion can be carried forward indefinitely, (iii) U.S. state NOLs of $10.5 billion that primarily expire between 2023 and 2042, (iv) Spanish NOLs of $0.5 billion that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesia NOLs of $0.5 billion that expire between 2024 and 2026. Valuation Allowances. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2022, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.0 billion at December 31, 2022, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits and U.S. federal NOLs, substantially all of its U.S. state NOLs, as well as a portion of its U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets and foreign NOLs. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs totaled $1.8 billion and other deferred tax assets totaled $0.7 billion at December 31, 2022. NOLs and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or NOLs can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or NOLs that can be implemented. The $102 million net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2022 is primarily related to $163 million of U.S. federal NOLs utilized during 2022, and a $22 million decrease related to expirations of U.S. foreign tax credits partially offset by an increase of $104 million, primarily associated with current year changes in U.S. federal temporary differences. U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 . In August 2022, the Act was signed into law, which includes, among other provisions, a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period, and a new excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of net corporate stock repurchases. The Act had no impact on FCX’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The provisions of the Act are applicable to FCX beginning January 1, 2023. Additional guidance related to how the CAMT provisions of the Act will be applied or otherwise administered is yet to be released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and may differ from FCX’s interpretations. FCX will continue to analyze the impacts as additional guidance is released. FCX expects the CAMT provisions will impact its U.S. tax position, and may further limit its ability to benefit from its U.S. NOLs. Other Events. In connection with the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, governments throughout the world announced measures that are intended to provide tax and other financial relief. Such measures include the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted in March 2021, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), enacted in March 2020. None of these measures resulted in material impacts to FCX’s provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. However, certain provisions of the CARES Act provided FCX with the opportunity to accelerate collections of tax refunds, primarily those associated with the U.S. alternative minimum tax (AMT). FCX fully collected all outstanding U.S. AMT refunds of $24 million in 2021 and $244 million in 2020. Indonesia Tax Matters. In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. In 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During fourth-quarter 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters. On December 30, 2019, PT-FI made a payment of $250 million based on its understanding of the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of the tax years 2012 through 2016, as well as tax years 2017 and 2018, and recorded net charges totaling $304 million for the year 2019. During 2020 , in connection with progress of the framework for resolution of the disputed matters, PT-FI recorded additional net charges of $46 million, including $9 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income, net and $35 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $2 million to provision for income tax expense. During 2021, PT-FI participated in discussions with the Indonesia Tax Office regarding progress on the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of tax years 2012 through 2016. As a result of these discussions and the revised positions taken by both the Indonesia Tax Office and PT-FI, FCX could no longer conclude a resolution of all of the disputed tax items at a more-likely-than-not threshold and PT-FI recorded additional net charges of $384 million, including $155 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other income (expense), net, $43 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $186 million to provision for income tax expense. During 2022, in conjunction with the framework for resolution of disputed matters and the closure of the 2018 corporate income tax audit, PT-FI recorded net charges of $13 million, including $5 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $8 million to provision for income taxes. PT-FI continues to engage with the Indonesia Tax Office in pursuit of clarification on certain aspects of the original framework for resolution of the disputed matters. In conjunction with the issuance of Government Regulation Number 50 of 2022, which stipulates that objection, tax court, and judicial review verdicts issued after the issuance of the harmonization law qualify for reduced penalties, PT-FI recorded net credits totaling $69 million in 2022 (including a credit of $76 million recorded to other income (expense), net and a charge of $7 million to provision for income taxes), which mostly related to the disputed matters discussed above. Peru Tax Matters. In 2016, the Peru parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate to 26 % in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions to 9.3 % in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 %, and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 %. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects it to a stable income tax rate of 32 % through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. Chile Tax Matters . In 2014, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from El Abra was subject to an effective 35 % tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, El Abra is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 % through 2019 and 44.5 % in 2020 and thereafter. In 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chile legislature so that the 35 % rate continued through 2021, increasing to 44.5 % in 2022 and thereafter. In January 2020, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that would further delay the 44.5 % rate until 2027 and thereafter. In 2010, the Chile legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023 mining royalty rates at FCX’s El Abra mine are based on a sliding scale of 5 % to 14 % (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. Tax positions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are based on their technical merits, more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities or have otherwise been effectively settled. Such tax positions reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income (expense), net rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $808 $474 $491 Additions: Prior year tax positions 26 330 56 Current year tax positions 25 71 60 Decreases: Prior year tax positions (12) (30) (82) Settlements with taxing authorities (37) (37) (51) Balance at end of year $810 $808 $474
============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $551 million at December 31, 2022, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with cost recovery methods and royalties and other related mining taxes, $620 million at December 31, 2021, and $307 million at December 31, 2020. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $810 million at December 31, 2022, included $689 million ($485 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current and prior-year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX's tax treatment of cost recovery methods and various non-deductible costs. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2023, FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2022, FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 24 U.S. states. The aggregate environmental obligation for approximately 60 % of the active remediation projects totaled less than $20 million at December 31, 2022. A summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

============================================================

a. Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis. b. Adjustments to environmental obligations are charged to operating income. Adjustments primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments. Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $3.7 billion, including $125 million in 2023, $120 million in 2024, $93 million in 2025, $100 million in 2026, $97 million in 2027 and $3.2 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2022, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.7 billion, including $1.6 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.3 billion and $4.1 billion on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis. At December 31, 2022, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $437 million at December 31, 2022. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984, a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrial uses on and around the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and four other companies (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) and the City of New York entered an Administrative Order on Consent to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify remedial options. The NCG’s RI/FS work and efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. The NCG submitted a final draft RI report to EPA in December 2022. The NCG expects to submit a draft FS report to EPA in late 2025 and currently expects EPA to select a creek-wide remedy in 2028, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. In early 2022, EPA asked the NCG to develop and evaluate remedial alternatives for an early action in the East Branch tributary of the creek. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $338 million at December 31, 2022. The final costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. Changes to the overall cost of this remedial obligation and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX established an environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation. Assessments of sediments in the adjacent Arthur Kill and sampling and analysis within the offsite area as we obtain access to residential properties are ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. The extent of contamination and potential remedial actions are uncertain and may take several years to evaluate. FCX’s environmental liability balance for historical smelter sites, including in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey, was $268 million at December 31, 2022. On January 30, 2017, a putative class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending, and FMC was added as a defendant. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants on-site and off-site through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for economic losses, including diminished property values, additional soil investigation and remediation and other damages. In September 2022, the parties completed re-briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The judge indicated in late 2022 that there likely would not be a decision on class certification until late 2023 or 2024. In December 2022, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action suit and individual claims by some property owners outside the settlement class area. The potential settlement (if effected in accordance with the agreement in principle) would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached and, if an agreement among the parties is reached, the implementation of a settlement would require, among other things, court approval. Given the uncertainties and complexities involved, FCX continues to prepare for trial and intends to vigorously defend the matter. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. Under the terms of the Consent Decree executed in May 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. In 2020, FCX reduced its associated obligation and recorded a $47 million credit to operating income to reflect the discounting effect of the recent and expected pace of project work under post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions. By letter dated September 29, 2021, EPA informed an FCX subsidiary that it does not expect to have funds sufficient to remediate sites covered by a bankruptcy settlement with Tronox and EPA considers a subsidiary of FCX to be potentially liable for 23 of these sites. However, based on recently available information from EPA, it is currently considered unlikely that EPA will deplete the available settlement dollars, at least in the near-term, and seek additional funds from FCX. FCX is also conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on approximately 15,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. A similar agreement is in place with the U.S. Forest Service for mine features on U.S. Forest Service land. Either BLM or the U.S. Forest Service may request additional assessment or remediation activities for other claims with mining features. FCX will update this obligation when it has a sufficient number of remedy decisions from the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service to support a reasonably certain range of outcomes. FCX expects it will take several years to complete this work. FCX’s environmental liability balance for the uranium mining sites was $439 million at December 31, 2022. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE

2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $2,716 $2,472 $2,505 Liabilities incurred 9 2 7 Settlements and revisions to cash flow estimates, net 381 a 331 a (13) Accretion expense 134 112 131 Dispositions — — (2) Spending (197) (201) (156) Balance at end of year 3,043 2,716 2,472 Less current portion (195) (200) (268) Long-term portion $2,848 $2,516 $2,204
============================================================

a. Includes adjustments at PT-FI, Morenci and Bagdad totaling $314 million for the year 2022 and adjustments at PT-FI totaling $397 million for the year 2021, see further discussion below. ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2022, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.5 billion, of which $0.9 billion was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2022, FCX had trust assets totaling $0.2 billion (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $0.4 billion. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. The agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments and completed a permit renewal for Chino in 2020 and Tyrone in 2021. At December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $534 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the ADEQ. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards during operations and closure. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the implementation cost, with a more detailed closure plan required at the time operations cease. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. Closure costs for facilities covered by APPs are required to be updated every six years and financial assurance mechanisms are required to be updated every two years. During 2022, the Morenci and Bagdad mines increased their AROs by $118 million and $65 million, respectively, associated with their updated closure strategies and plans for stockpiles and tailings impoundments that were submitted to ADEQ for approval. FCX will continue evaluating and, as necessary, updating its closure plans and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites, and any such updates may also result in increased costs that could be significant. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $581 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. In March 2020, the Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) approved Henderson’s proposed update to its closure plan and closure cost estimate. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. In accordance with its permit from DRMS, Climax will submit an updated reclamation plan and cost estimate in 2024. As of December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $162 million for its Colorado operations Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Chile Mining and Geology Agency. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, El Abra submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval of the updated closure plan and cost estimates was received in August 2020, and did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $98 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, Cerro Verde is preparing to submit its updated closure plan and cost estimate in February 2023. At December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $171 million for its Cerro Verde operation, which includes preliminary cost estimates associated with Cerro Verde’s updated closure plan. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities under the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. In 2021, the construction time frame for reclamation of the West Wanagon overburden stockpile was extended from 2025 to 2029 because safety constraints for working in steep and difficult terrain has reduced labor and equipment operating efficiencies. The time frame extension resulted in longer and escalating fixed costs, combined with additional anticipated volumes of stockpile material to be moved. In 2022, estimated costs associated with West Wanagon slope stabilization remediation and reclamation activities increased primarily as a result of increased material needed for stockpile stabilization and increased costs for equipment, operations and maintenance, increased manpower/headcount allocation and contractor/consultant cost impacts. As a result of these changes, ARO adjustments of $131 million were recorded in 2022 (of which $116 million related to the depleted Grasberg open pit and charged to production and delivery costs) and $397 million in 2021 (of which $340 million related to the depleted Grasberg open pit and charged to production and delivery costs). At December 31, 2022, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $1.1 billion for its PT-FI operations. Indonesia government regulations issued in 2010 require a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. At December 31, 2022, PT-FI had restricted time deposits totaling $103 million for mine closure and reclamation guarantees. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). As of December 31, 2022, FM O&G AROs cover approximately 110 wells and 105 platforms and other structures and it had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $328 million. Litigation. In addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and above under “Environmental,” we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. SEC regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any current pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants, in 13 cases filed in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulfur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, through the Attorney General and separately through the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in two of the five cases that had been set for trial, both originally filed on November 8, 2013: Parish of Plaquemines v. ConocoPhillips Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-982, Div. B and Parish of Plaquemines v. Hilcorp Energy Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-999, Div. B. In 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all 13 cases, and as of October 2022, all parties have executed the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. FCX recorded a charge in 2019 for the initial payment of $15 million, which FCX expects to pay in trust to later be deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) if the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund within three years of execution of the settlement agreement. Upon payment of the $15 million, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all 13 pending cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be $23.5 million, including the initial $15 million payment. The settlement agreement will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of $4.25 million beginning in 2023 provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of those annual installments are conditioned only on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, but all subsequent installments are also conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, resulting in the $23.5 million maximum total payment obligation. Asbestos and Talc Claims . Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining and processing from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. In accordance with the terms of the 1992 transactions and subsequent agreements, Imerys undertook the defense and indemnification of Cyprus Mines and CAMC in talc lawsuits. Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations and took responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, in February 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys stopped defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys took the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access could be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently on hold. In January 2021, Imerys filed the form of a settlement and release agreement to be entered into by CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX, Imerys and the other debtors, tort claimants’ committee and future claims representative in the Imerys bankruptcy. In accordance with the global settlement, among other things, (1) CAMC will pay a total of $130 million in cash to a settlement trust in seven annual installments, which will be guaranteed by FCX, and (2) CAMC and Cyprus Mines and their affiliates will contribute to the settlement trust all rights that they have to the proceeds of certain legacy insurance policies as well as indemnity rights they have against Johnson & Johnson, and Imerys also obtained an injunction temporarily staying approximately 950 talc lawsuits against CAMC and Cyprus Mines, which has been extended through July 2023. The interim stay is a component of the global settlement but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will continue to impose the interim stay. As part of the global settlement, Cyprus Mines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2021. In connection with executing the settlement and release agreement, FCX concluded that it has a probable loss and, in 2020, recorded a $130 million charge to environmental obligations and shutdown costs. Mediation to resolve open issues in the Imerys and Cyprus Mines bankruptcy cases, including the adequacy of the global settlement, is ongoing, and FCX expects it to continue at least through first-quarter 2023. FCX’s global settlement is subject to, among other things, votes by claimants in both the Imerys and Cyprus Mines bankruptcy cases as well as bankruptcy court approvals in both cases, and there can be no assurance that the global settlement will be successfully implemented. FCX has a $130 million liability balance at December 31, 2022, associated with the proposed settlement. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT (National Superintendency of Customs and Administration) assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period from December 2006 to December 2013. No royalty assessments were issued for the years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15-year stability agreement. Cerro Verde contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. During 2021, Cerro Verde paid the balance of its royalty dispute liabilities and has no remaining exposure associated with the royalty dispute with the Peruvian tax authorities. On February 28, 2020, FCX filed on its own behalf and on behalf of Cerro Verde international arbitration proceedings against the Peruvian government under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The hearing on the merits is scheduled to take place in May 2023. In April 2020, SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. (SMM Cerro Verde), another shareholder of Cerro Verde, filed parallel international arbitration proceedings against the Peruvian government under the Netherlands-Peru Bilateral Investment Treaty. SMM Cerro Verde’s hearing on the merits took place in February 2023. No amounts have been recorded for potential gain contingencies associated with the international arbitration proceedings. Other Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalties and Interest Total 2003 to 2008 $48 $130 $178 2009 56 52 108 2010 54 125 179 2011 and 2012 42 73 115 2013 48 66 114 2014 to 2017 73 30 103 $321 $476 $797
============================================================

As of December 31, 2022, Cerro Verde had paid $741 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $408 million, resulting in a net receivable of $333 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. Cerro Verde’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $0.7 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $0.4 billion has not been charged to expense. Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesia government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 % export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments, including potential penalties follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalties and Interest Total 2005 $62 $29 $91 2007 45 22 67 2012 and 2013 41 41 82 2014 and 2015 108 — 108 2016 257 336 593 2017 7 2 9 $520 $430 $950
============================================================

As of December 31, 2022, PT-FI had paid $193 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $181 million, resulting in a net receivable of $12 million (included in other assets), which PT-FI believes is collectible. PT-FI’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $0.9 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $0.4 billion has not been charged to expense. Surface Water Taxes . PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Central Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. As a result, PT-FI offered to pay one trillion rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged $69 million to production and delivery costs in 2018. In 2019, PT-FI agreed to a final settlement of 1.394 trillion rupiah (approximately $99 million) and recorded an incremental charge of $28 million. PT-FI paid 708.5 billion rupiah ($50 million) in October 2019, and paid the balance of 685.5 billion rupiah ($48 million) during 2021. Withholding Tax Assessments . In January 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court rendered an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in November 2017. PT-FI currently has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total $42 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2022, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022), including penalties and interest. Smelter Development Progress . In January 2021, the Indonesia government levied an administrative fine of $149 million for the period from March 30, 2020, through September 30, 2020, on PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on its greenfield smelter as of July 31, 2020. On January 13, 2021, PT-FI responded to the Indonesia government objecting to the fine because of events outside of its control causing a delay of the greenfield smelter’s development progress. PT-FI believes that its communications during 2020 with the Indonesia government were not properly considered before the administrative fine was levied. In June 2021, the Indonesia government issued a ministerial decree for the calculation of an administrative fine for lack of smelter development in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, PT-FI recorded charges totaling $16 million for a potential settlement of the administrative fine. In January 2022, the Indonesia government submitted a new estimate of the administrative fine totaling $57 million, and in March 2022, PT-FI paid the administrative fine and recorded an additional charge of $41 million. Based on PT-FI’s revised smelter construction schedule, PT-FI does not believe any additional fines should be applied and will dispute any attempts by the Indonesia government to levy additional fines, which could be significant. PT-FI and PT Smelting Export Licenses . Indonesia regulations require PT-FI and PT Smelting to renew their export licenses annually (PT-FI’s export license for copper concentrate is subject to review by the Indonesia government every six months, depending on greenfield smelter construction progress). PT-FI’s current export license is scheduled for renewal in March 2023, and PT-FI is preparing its renewal application. PT Smelting’s current anodes slimes export license expires in November 2023. While PT-FI's special mining license (IUPK) provides that exports continue through 2023 (subject to force majeure considerations), recent press reports have indicated that the Indonesia government is considering a ban of copper concentrate exports effective in June 2023 under regulations that were issued in 2020 and 2021. In addition, PT Smelting exports may also be restricted (contrary to the expiration date of PT Smelting’s current export license noted above). PT-FI plans to work cooperatively with the Indonesia government to continue exports as required until the smelter is fully commissioned. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $312 million at December 31, 2022, primarily associated with environmental obligations, AROs and for copper concentrate shipments from PT-FI to Atlantic Copper as required by Indonesia regulations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $488 million at December 31, 2022, primarily associated with environmental obligations and AROs. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2022, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $62 million, which consisted of a current portion of $10 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $52 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $23 million (a current portion of $5 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $18 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incidental to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Leases. The components of FCX’s leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31 follow:

FCX payments included in operating cash flows for its lease liabilities totaled $41 million in 2022, $54 million in 2021 and $36 million in 2020. FCX payments included in financing cash flows for its lease liabilities totaled $7 million in 2022, $25 million in 2021 and $4 million in 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities was 4.1 % (4.2 % as of December 31, 2021) and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 12.0 years (12.4 years as of December 31, 2021).

============================================================

Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2022, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $4.8 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($3.6 billion), transportation services ($0.5 billion) and electricity ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations total $1.6 billion in 2023, $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.0 billion in 2025, $0.3 billion in 2026, $0.1 billion in 2027 and $0.3 billion thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. IUPK - Indonesia. In December 2018, FCX completed the 2018 Transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the 2018 Transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former Contract of Work, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI was granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the development of additional smelting capacity in Indonesia by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested as a result of COVID-19 mitigation measures, subject to the approval of the Indonesia government, refer to Note 12), and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041, assuming the additional extension is received. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 % corporate income tax rate, a 10 % profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 % for copper, 3.75 % for gold and 3.25 % for silver. PT-FI’s royalties charged against revenues totaled $357 million in 2022, $319 million in 2021 and $160 million in 2020. Dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX totaled $2.5 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 and are subject to a 10% withholding tax. There were no dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX in 2020. The IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 %, declining to 2.5 % when smelter development progress exceeds 30 % and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia exceeds 50 %. In December 2022, PT-FI received approval, based on construction progress achieved, for a reduction in export duties from 5 % to 2.5 %, which was effective immediately. At December 31, 2022, construction of the greenfield smelter was approximately 50 % complete. PT-FI’s export duties totaled $325 million in 2022, $218 million in 2021 and $92 million in 2020. Upon receiving verification and approval from the Indonesia government that construction progress has exceeded 50 %, PT-FI expects export duties may be eliminated. Beginning in 2019, the IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, which are recognized in production and delivery costs. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesia government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond to support its commitment to construct a greenfield smelter in Indonesia ($133 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2022). Chiyoda Contract . In July 2021, PT-FI awarded a construction contract to Chiyoda for the construction of a greenfield smelter in Gresik, Indonesia with an estimated contract cost of $2.8 billion. The smelter is expected to be commissioned during 2024. Indemnification. The PT-FI divestment agreement, discussed in Note 3, provides that FCX will indemnify MIND ID and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to MIND ID in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. FCX had accrued $74 million as of December 31, 2022, and $78 million as of December 31, 2021, (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) related to this indemnification. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working and engagement relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide FCX’s practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, health, training, and cultural programs. PT-FI provides funding and technical assistance to support various community development programs in areas such as health, education, economic development and local infrastructure. In 1996, PT-FI established a social investment fund with the aim of contributing to social and economic development in the Mimika Regency. Prior to 2019, the fund was mainly managed by the Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Organization, a community-led institution. In 2019, a new foundation, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Empowerment Foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK) was established, and in 2020, PT-FI appointed YPMAK to assist in distributing a significant portion of PT-FI’s funding to support the development and empowerment of the local indigenous Papuan people. YPMAK is governed by a Board of Governors consisting of seven representatives, including four from PT-FI. In addition, since 2001, PT-FI has voluntarily established and contributed to land rights trust funds administered by Amungme and Kamoro representatives that focus on socioeconomic initiatives, human rights and environmental issues. PT-FI is committed to the continued funding of YPMAK programs and the land rights trust funds, as well as for other local-community development initiatives through 2041 and has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health, education and local economic development. PT-FI recorded charges totaling $123 million in 2022, $109 million in 2021 and $67 million in 2020 to cost of sales for social and economic development programs. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. In April 2020, FCX entered into forward sales contracts for 150 million pounds of copper for settlement in May and June of 2020. The forward sales provided for fixed pricing of $2.34 per pound of copper on approximately 60 % of North America's sales volumes for May and June 2020. These contracts resulted in hedging losses totaling $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no remaining forward sales contracts after June 30, 2020 . A discussion of FCX’s other derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments - Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod and cathode customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 82 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.80 per pound, with maturities through May 2024. A summary of (losses) gains recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows (in millions):

============================================================

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and the London gold prices as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price and the London gold price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2022, follows:

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in production and delivery costs. At December 31, 2022, Atlantic Copper held net copper forward purchase contracts for 6 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.82 per pound, with maturities through February 2023.

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances.

============================================================

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $170 million. Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted trust assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, dividends payable and debt. The carrying value for these financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2022, FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values). Trade Accounts Receivable Agreements. In 2021, PT-FI entered into agreements to sell certain trade accounts receivables to unrelated third-party financial institutions. The agreements were entered into in the normal course of business to fund the working capital for the additional quantity of copper to be supplied by PT-FI to PT Smelting. The balances sold under the agreements were excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of PT-FI and its creditors, (ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) PT-FI has no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables. In addition, PT-FI provides no other forms of continued financial support to the purchaser of the receivables once the receivables are sold. Gross amounts sold under these arrangements totaled $444 million in 2022 and $431 million in 2021. Discounts on the sold receivables totaled $4 million in 2022 and $2 million in 2021. As a result of the new tolling arrangements discussed in Note 3, no additional receivables will be sold under these agreements beginning in 2023. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):

Includes $1.8 billion of cash designated for smelter development projects related to PT-FI’s April 2022 senior notes offering. NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2022. FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

Excludes time deposits (which approximated fair value) included in (i) other current assets of $118 million at December 31, 2022, and $114 million at December 31, 2021, and (ii) other assets of $133 million at December 31, 2022, and $132 million at December 31, 2021, primarily associated with an assurance bond to support PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a greenfield smelter in Indonesia (refer to Note 13 for further discussion) and PT-FI’s closure and reclamation guarantees (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). c. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion and balance sheet classifications. d. Recorded at cost except for debt assumed in acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value at the respective acquisition dates. Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government mortgage-backed securities, government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. In December 2016, FCX’s sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties included up to $150 million in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration is being received over time as future cash flows are realized from a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform, with the related payments commencing in third-quarter 2018. The contingent consideration included in (i) other current assets totaled $20 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and (ii) other assets totaled $47 million at December 31, 2022, and $70 million at December 31, 2021. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is primarily valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2022, as compared to those techniques used at December 31, 2021. A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer. Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 13 % of FCX’s consolidated revenues in 2022, 14 % in 2021 and 12 % in 2020, and they are the only customer that accounted for 10% or more of FCX’s annual consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2022. Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $1.7 billion in 2022, $1.4 billion in 2021 and $0.9 billion in 2020, and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $3.0 billion in 2022, $3.1 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30 % of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 2 % was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2023 or that had expired as of December 31, 2022, and continue to be negotiated. In February 2022, PT-FI completed negotiations with its unions on a two-year collective bargaining agreement that is effective through March 2024. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other segments, including Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining and on 39.5 % of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting (25.0 % prior to April 30, 2021) until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. Beginning in 2023, PT-FI's commercial arrangement with PT Smelting converted to a tolling arrangement. Under this arrangement, PT-FI pays PT Smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title to all products for sale to third parties (i.e., there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting). FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star), Bagdad, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. During 2022, the Morenci mine produced 43 % of FCX’s North America copper and 15 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production. South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. During 2022, the Cerro Verde mine produced 83 % of FCX’s South America copper and 23 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production. Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. During 2022, PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district produced 37 % of FCX’s consolidated copper production and 99 % of FCX’s consolidated gold production. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode and rod. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2022, Atlantic Copper purchased 7 % of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 10 % from FCX’s South America mining operations and 18 % from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items, which include the Miami smelter, Freeport Cobalt (until its sale in September 2021), molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, the greenfield smelter and PMR in Indonesia, certain non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee and Tohono in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2022, have been prepared using industry accepted practice and conform to the disclosure requirements under Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. FCX’s proven and probable mineral reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry. Mineral reserves, as used in the reserve data presented here, mean an estimate of tonnage and grade of measured and indicated mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. Proven mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. To classify an estimate as a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must possess a high degree of confidence of tonnage, grade and quality. Probable mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of an indicated or, in some cases, a measured mineral resource. The qualified person’s level of confidence will be lower in determining a probable mineral reserve than it would be in determining a proven mineral reserve. To classify an estimate as a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person’s confidence must still be sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable considering reasonable investment and market assumptions. FCX’s mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2022, were determined using metals price assumptions of $3.00 per pound for copper, $1,500 per ounce for gold and $12 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, LME copper settlement prices averaged $3.67 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $1,789 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Platts Metals Daily averaged $14.44 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries, where applicable.

Note: Totals may not foot because of rounding. a. Estimated consolidated recoverable copper reserves included 1.8 billion pounds in leach stockpiles and 0.3 billion pounds in mill stockpiles. b. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through 2041. As a result, PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Note 13 for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK). As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, PT-FI expects to mine 46 % of its proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at December 31, 2022, representing 49 % of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 51 % of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable gold reserves. c. Consolidated mineral reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves of 340 million ounces of silver, which were determined using $20 per ounce. d. Net equity interest mineral reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note 3 for further discussion of FCX’s ownership in subsidiaries).

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; • Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and • Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Table of C ontents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 15, 2022 Table of C ontents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

============================================================
Uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.

Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluated third-party tax or legal opinions obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Note 12 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $1.7 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to evaluate whether an environmental loss has been incurred and to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, the duration and effectiveness of the chosen remedial strategy, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental loss contingency calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingencies. To test the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s models and tested the significant assumptions discussed above along with the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We utilized our environmental professionals to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Table of C ontents Freeport-McMoRan Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2021, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 percent-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Note 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. FMC’s unincorporated joint venture at Morenci is reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20 percent, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other (expense) income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains totaled $66 million in 2021, $34 million in 2020 and $24 million in 2019. Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a greenfield smelter in Indonesia; and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds. Table of C ontents Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Process rates and copper recoveries for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Recovery adjustments will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, SX/EW, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Table of C ontents Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable mineral reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) measured and indicated mineral resources, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Table of C ontents Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. AROs associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Table of C ontents Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income (loss) per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock. Stock options for 5 million shares of common stock in 2021, 31 million shares in 2020 and 42 million shares in 2019 were excluded. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Reclassifications. For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to other, net on FCX’s consolidated statements of cash flows to conform with the current year presentation. Additionally, FCX has revised prior year amounts related to activities associated with its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits in conjunction with uncertain tax positions. See Note 11 for further detail. Subsequent Events. FCX evaluated events after December 31, 2021, and through the date the financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these financial statements. Table of C ontents NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS Cobalt Business. In September 2021, FCX’s 56 -percent-owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited (KCHL), completed the sale of its remaining cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (Freeport Cobalt) to Jervois Global Limited (Jervois) for $208 million (before post-closing adjustments), consisting of cash consideration of $173 million and 7 percent of Jervois common stock (valued at $35 million at the time of closing). At closing, Freeport Cobalt’s assets included cash of approximately $20 million and other net assets of $125 million. FCX recorded a gain of $60 million ($34 million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2021 associated with this transaction. In addition, KCHL will have the right to receive contingent consideration of up to $40 million based on the future performance of Freeport Cobalt. Any gain related to the contingent consideration will be recognized when received. In fourth-quarter 2019, FCX completed the sale of its cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and related cobalt cathode precursor business (consisting of approximately $271 million of assets and $63 million of liabilities at the time of closing) to Umicore for total cash consideration of approximately $200 million, including approximately $50 million of working capital. FCX recorded a gain of $59 million in 2019 ($33 million to net loss attributable to common stock) associated with this transaction. Following these transactions, FCX no longer has cobalt operations. PT Smelting. On April 30, 2021, PT-FI acquired 14.5 percent of the outstanding common stock of PT Smelting, a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia, for $33 million, increasing its ownership interest from 25.0 percent to 39.5 percent. The remaining outstanding shares of PT Smelting continue to be owned by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. PT-FI has continued to account for its investment in PT Smelting using the equity method since it does not have control over PT Smelting. On November 30, 2021, PT-FI entered into a convertible loan agreement to fund the expansion of PT Smelting’s current capacity by 30 percent to 1.3 million metric tons of concentrate per year. Upon completion of the expansion project, targeted for year-end 2023, PT-FI’s loan will convert into PT Smelting equity resulting in a majority ownership interest and consolidation of PT Smelting in FCX’s consolidated financial statements. Kisanfu Transaction. In December 2020, FCX completed the sale of its interests in the Kisanfu undeveloped project to a wholly owned subsidiary of China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $550 million, with after-tax net cash proceeds totaling $415 million. The Kisanfu project, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is an undeveloped cobalt and copper resource. FCX did not have any proven and probable mineral reserves associated with the Kisanfu project. FCX recorded a gain of $486 million in 2020 associated with this transaction. Timok Transaction. In 2016, FCX sold an interest in the upper zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia (the 2016 Transaction). In December 2019, FCX completed the sale of its interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project to an affiliate of the purchaser in the 2016 Transaction, for cash consideration of $240 million at closing plus the right to future contingent payments of up to $150 million. These future contingent payments will be based on the future sale of products (as defined in the agreement) from the Timok lower zone. For a period of 12 months after the third anniversary of the initial sale of products from the Timok lower zone, the purchaser can settle, or FCX can demand payment of, such deferred payment obligation, in each case, for a total of $60 million. As these deferred payments are contingent upon future production (the Timok lower zone project is still pre-operational) and would result in gain recognition, no amounts were recorded upon the closing of the transaction. Subsequent recognition will be based on the gain contingency model, in which the consideration would be recorded in the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. This is expected to be when FCX (i) is provided periodic product sales information by the purchaser or (ii) gives notice to the purchaser or receives notice from the purchaser regarding the settlement of the deferred payments for $60 million. In addition, in lieu of payment upon achievement of defined development milestones provided for in the 2016 Transaction, the purchaser agreed to pay $107 million in three installment payments of $45 million (collected in 2020), $50 million (collected in 2021), and $12 million by March 31, 2022. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of $343 million in 2019, consisting of the cash consideration ($240 million) and the aggregate discounted amount of the three installment payments ($103 million). Table of C ontents TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its 70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to CMOC for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeded $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeded $20 per pound, both during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration was considered a derivative, and the fair value was adjusted through December 31, 2019. FCX realized and collected in January 2020 contingent consideration of $60 million because the average cobalt price exceeded $20 per pound during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019 (no amount was realized associated with the copper price). Gains resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative totaling $3 million in 2019 were included in net income from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt prices. In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results from TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and molybdenum from mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2021, FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FMC has a 72 percent interest in Morenci (refer to “Joint Venture - Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100 percent of the other North America mines. At December 31, 2021, operating mines in South America were Cerro Verde (53.56 percent owned) located in Peru and El Abra (51 percent owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 2021, FMC’s net assets totaled $18.4 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $12.6 billion. FCX had $111 million in loans outstanding to FMC outstanding at December 31, 2021. FCX owns 48.76 percent of PT-FI (refer to “PT-FI Divestment”). At December 31, 2021, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $12.7 billion and its retained earnings totaled $8.4 billion. FCX had no loans to PT-FI outstanding at December 31, 2021. FCX owns 100 percent of the outstanding Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain) common stock. At December 31, 2021, Atlantic Copper’s net assets totaled $167 million and its accumulated deficit totaled $379 million. FCX had $274 million in loans to Atlantic Copper outstanding at December 31, 2021. PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 transaction). Pursuant to the divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum, also known as MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 percent of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama). In connection with the 2018 transaction, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of PT Rio Tinto Indonesia that held the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (26.24 percent) and PTI’s (25.00 percent) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 percent and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 percent. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent through 2022 and 48.67 percent thereafter (see further discussion below). FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the 2018 transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which Table of C ontents consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX has concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitles FCX to approximately 81 percent of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining 19 percent paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI paid dividends totaling $1.3 billion during 2021, of which $1.0 billion was paid to FCX. No other dividends have been paid by PT-FI during the Initial Period. PT-FI’s net income for 2021 totaled $2.4 billion, of which $2.0 billion was attributed to FCX, and $765 million for 2020, of which $621 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s net loss for 2019 totaled $203 million, of which $165 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s cumulative net income from December 21, 2018, through December 31, 2021, totaled $2.9 billion, of which $2.3 billion was attributed to FCX. The above-described attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss applies only through the Initial Period. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss will be based on equity ownership percentages (48.76 percent for FCX, 26.24 percent for PT Inalum and 25.00 percent for PTI). For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Joint Venture. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. FMC owns a 72 percent undivided interest in Morenci via an unincorporated joint venture. The remaining 28 percent is owned by Sumitomo (15 percent) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13 percent). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. FMC purchased 82 million pounds of Morenci’s copper cathode from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. at market prices for $349 million during 2021. FMC had receivables from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. totaling $20 million at December 31, 2021, and $15 million at December 31, 2020. NOTE 4.

Estimated metals in stockpiles not expected to be recovered within the next 12 months. FCX recorded NRV inventory adjustments to decrease metals inventory carrying values totaling $16 million in 2021, primarily associated with stockpiles no longer expected to be leached; $96 million in 2020, associated with lower market prices for copper ($58 million) and molybdenum ($38 million); and $179 million in 2019, associated with lower market prices for molybdenum ($84 million), cobalt ($58 million) and copper ($37 million). Refer to Note 16 for metals inventory adjustments by business segment. Table of C ontents FCX's Morenci mine has experienced improved recoveries at certain of its leach stockpiles and following an analysis of column testing results, Morenci concluded it had sufficient evidence to increase its estimated recoveries for certain of its leach stockpiles effective July 1, 2021. As a result of the revised recoveries, Morenci increased its estimated recoverable copper in leach stockpiles, net to its joint venture interest, by 191 million pounds. The effect of this change in estimate reduced site production and delivery costs and increased net income by $112 million ($0.08 per share) in 2021. NOTE 5.

Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, FCX had no borrowings outstanding and $8 million in letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion could be used for additional letters of credit. Availability under FCX’s revolving credit facility consists of $3.28 billion maturing April 2024 and $220 million maturing April 2023. For PT-FI, $500 million of FCX’s revolving credit facility is available. FCX’s revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants and representations, and also contains a number of negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of FCX’s subsidiaries that are not borrowers or guarantors to incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) and FCX’s or its subsidiaries’ abilities to: create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in mergers, liquidations and dissolutions; and sell assets. FCX’s revolving credit facility also contains financial ratios governing maximum total leverage and minimum interest expense coverage. At December 31, 2021, FCX was in compliance with its revolving credit facility covenants. In December 2021, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC, a 100 -percent-owned subsidiary of FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G) and indirect subsidiary of FCX, was released as co-borrower from FCX’s revolving credit facility and released as guarantor from all of the indentures relating to FCX’s outstanding senior notes. Interest on loans made under the revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings. Certain of FCX’s debt agreements, including its revolving credit facility, reference LIBOR which is being phased out and replaced with alternative reference rates. FCX does not expect the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. Senior Notes. In December 2021, FCX redeemed all of its outstanding $524 million aggregate principal amount of 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In July 2020, FCX completed the sale of $650 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2028 and $850 million of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2030 for proceeds, net of underwriting fees, totaling $1.485 billion. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. FCX used $1.4 billion of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase a portion of its outstanding 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022, 3.875% Senior Notes due 2023 and 4.55% Senior Notes due 2024, and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. The remaining net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes. In March 2020, FCX completed the sale of $700 million of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2028 and $600 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2030 for proceeds, net of underwriting fees, totaling $1.285 billion. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. FCX used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase a portion of its 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and its 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022 and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. In April 2020, FCX used the remaining net proceeds to fund the make-whole redemption of all of its remaining 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with the transaction.

FCX’s senior notes contain limitations on liens and rank equally with FCX’s other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. PT-FI Credit Facility . In July 2021, PT-FI entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year, unsecured credit facility (consisting of a $667 million term loan and a $333 million revolving credit facility) to fund project costs in connection with the PT Smelting expansion and construction of a precious metals refinery (PMR), and for PT-FI’s general corporate purposes. The term loan allows for borrowings up to $667 million within the first three years, and then amortizes in four installments, with 15 percent of the outstanding balance due in January 2025, 15 percent due in July 2025, 35 percent due in January 2026 and the remaining 35 percent due in July 2026. The $333 million revolving credit facility is available for drawings until June 2026. Amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.875 % or 2.125 %, as defined by the agreement . PT-FI’s credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants and representations and also contains standard covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of PT-FI to incur additional indebtedness; create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; sell assets; and modify or amend the shareholders agreement or related governance structure. The credit facility also contains financial ratios governing maximum total leverage and minimum interest expense coverage and certain environmental and social compliance requirements. At December 31, 2021, PT-FI was in compliance with its credit facility covenants. As of December 31, 2021, $443 million ($432 million net of debt issuance costs) was drawn under the PT-FI Term Loan and no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facilit y. Cerro Verde Term Loan. Repayments of the Cerro Verde Term Loan totaled $200 million in 2021, $305 million in 2020 and $200 million in 2019, with the remaining balance of $325 million due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. Interest under the Term Loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s Term Loan was 2.00 percent at December 31, 2021. Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans.

a. Refer to Note 7 for current portion. b. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. c. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering some U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. See below for discussion of a 2020 plan amendment. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s primary investment objectives for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) are to maintain funds sufficient to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due, minimize the volatility of the plan’s funded status to the extent practical, and to maintain prudent levels of risk consistent with the plan’s investment policy. Historically, FMC plan assets have been invested in a balanced portfolio of return-seeking assets and risk-mitigating assets, with the allocation between these portfolios dependent on the funded status of the plan. During 2021, FCX reallocated essentially all of the portfolio to risk-mitigating assets with the objective of minimizing funded-status volatility. The risk-mitigating assets are allocated among multiple fixed income managers. The current target allocation of the portfolio is long-duration credit (50 percent); long-duration U.S. government/credit (20 percent); core fixed income (16 percent); long-term U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS) (13 percent); and cash equivalents (1 percent). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 3.00 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2022, which was based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments together with the Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum. The participant has elected to receive an equivalent lump sum payment. The payment will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 14,198 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2021, and 14,034 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2020. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum severance to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7.00 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2022. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for qualified and non-qualified plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

a. Employer contributions for 2022 are currently expected to approximate $112 million for the FCX plans and $1 million for the PT-FI plan (based on a December 31, 2021, exchange rate of 14,198 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar), and are subject to change. In August 2020, the FMC Retirement Plan, the largest FMC plan, was amended such that, effective September 1, 2020, participants no longer accrue any additional benefits. As a result, FCX remeasured its pension assets and benefit obligation as of July 31, 2020. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets used for the July 31, 2020, remeasurement were 2.40 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively. The remeasurement and curtailment resulted in the projected benefit obligation increasing by $184 million and plan assets increasing by $103 million. In addition, FCX recognized a curtailment loss of $4 million in 2020. During 2021, the actuarial gain of $117 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 2.50 percent to 2.85 percent . During 2020, the actuarial loss of $308 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 3.40 percent to 2.50 percent, offset by the FMC Retirement Plan amendment to discontinue additional benefits. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s pension plans for the years ended December 31 follow:

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to prices derived using significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to prices derived using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) primarily require up to a two-business-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter (with a 30-calendar-day notice), subject to available cash. Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

============================================================

a. Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits. Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

a. Based on a December 31, 2021, exchange rate of 14,198 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar. Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $57 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2021, and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $69 million at December 31, 2020. FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $6 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $35 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2021, and a current portion of $6 million and a long-term portion of $42 million at December 31, 2020. FCX also sponsors a retirement savings plan for most of its U.S. employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with specified guidelines. The savings plan is a qualified 401(k) plan for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. Participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options under the plan. FCX contributes to the plan and matches a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides a nonqualified unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $51 million at December 31, 2021, and $49 million at December 31, 2020, all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for the employee savings plan totaled $95 million in 2021, $40 million in 2020 and $85 million in 2019. The costs were lower in 2020, compared with 2021 and 2019, because of a temporary suspension of FCX contributions implemented as part of FCX’s April 2020 revised operating plans. FCX contributions resumed on January 1, 2021. FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Financial Policy. In February 2021, FCX’s Board of Directors (Board) adopted a financial policy for the allocation of cash flows aligned with FCX’s strategic objectives of maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash returns to shareholders while advancing opportunities for future growth. The policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50 percent of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interests would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to FCX maintaining its net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion (excluding project debt for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia). In February 2021, the Board reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock (base dividend), and on November 1, 2021, the Board approved (i) a new share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $3.0 billion of FCX common stock and (ii) a variable cash dividend on FCX’s common stock for 2022. In fourth-quarter 2021, FCX acquired 12.7 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $488 million ($38.32 per share). Through February 15, 2022, FCX acquired 18.2 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $710 million ($39.10 per share) and $2.3 billion remains available for repurchases. On December 22, 2021, FCX declared dividends totaling $0.15 per share on its common stock, which was paid on February 1, 2022, to common stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022. This payment includes a $0.075 per share quarterly base cash dividend and a $0.075 per share quarterly variable cash dividend. The declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) and timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of FCX’s Board and management, respectively, and is subject to a number of factors, including maintaining FCX’s net debt target, capital availability, FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, business prospects, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by FCX’s Board or management, as applicable. FCX’s share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the Board’s discretion. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2021, 30.7 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans. Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options vest in one-third annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The award agreements also provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. A summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, follows:

============================================================

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the expected annual dividend at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. Information related to stock options during the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

As of December 31, 2021, FCX had $5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 years. Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after three years . The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.7 million for 2019, 0.8 million for 2020 and 0.3 million for 2021, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/- up to 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. All of FCX’s executive officers who hold PSUs are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests. A summary of outstanding stock-settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2021, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, follows:

The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs granted was $62 million during 2021, $47 million during 2020 and $24 million during 2019. The total intrinsic value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs vested was $56 million during 2021, $18 million during 2020 and $26 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2021, FCX had $17 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.2 years. Cash-Settled RSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests. A summary of outstanding cash-settled RSUs as of December 31, 2021, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, follows:

Income taxes are provided on the earnings of FCX’s material foreign subsidiaries under the assumption that these earnings will be distributed. FCX has not provided deferred income taxes for other differences between the book and tax carrying amounts of its investments in material foreign subsidiaries as FCX considers its ownership positions to be permanent in duration, and quantification of the related deferred tax liability is not practicable.

============================================================

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2021, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.5 billion that will expire between 2022 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of $6.1 billion that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, of which $0.2 billion can be carried forward indefinitely, (iii) U.S. state NOLs of $10.9 billion that primarily expire between 2022 and 2041, (iv) Spanish NOLs of $0.5 billion that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesia NOLs of $0.9 billion that expire between 2022 and 2026. Valuation Allowances. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2021, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more- likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits and U.S. federal NOLs, substantially all of its U.S. state NOLs, and a portion of its foreign NOLs. Valuation allowances totaled $4.7 billion at December 31, 2020, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal NOLs, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state NOLs. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs totaled $2.0 billion and other deferred tax assets totaled $561 million at December 31, 2021. NOLs and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or NOLs can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented. The $645 million net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2021 is primarily related to a $219 million decrease associated with U.S. federal NOLs utilized during 2021, a $105 million decrease related to expirations of U.S. foreign tax credits and $228 million decrease associated with PT Rio Tinto NOLs resulting from positive evidence supporting future taxable income against which net operating losses can be used. Changes in assumptions about future taxable income against which PT Rio Tinto NOLs can be utilized resulted from delays in timing of the anticipated merger of PT Rio Tinto into PT-FI. Other Events. In connection with the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, governments throughout the world announced measures that are intended to provide tax and other financial relief. Such measures include the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), enacted on March 27, 2020. None of these measures resulted in material impacts to FCX’s provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. However, certain provisions of the CARES Act provided FCX with the opportunity to accelerate collections of tax refunds, primarily those associated with the U.S. alternative minimum tax (AMT). FCX collected U.S. AMT refunds of $24 million in 2021 and $244 million in 2020. FCX continues to evaluate income tax accounting considerations of COVID-19 measures as they develop, including any impact on its measurement of existing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. FCX will recognize any impact from COVID-19 related changes to tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. Indonesia Tax Matters. In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. In 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During the fourth quarter of 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters. On December 30, 2019, PT-FI made a payment of $250 million based on its understanding of the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of the tax years 2012 through 2016, as well as tax years 2017 and 2018. Additional administrative steps would need to be completed by both PT-FI and the Indonesia Tax Office in order to implement the resolution. During October 2021, PT-FI participated in discussions with the Indonesia tax office regarding progress on the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of tax years 2012 through 2016. As a result of these discussions and the revised positions taken by both the Indonesia tax office and PT-FI, FCX believes it can no longer conclude a resolution of all of the disputed tax items at a more-likely-than-not threshold. PT-FI will continue to engage with the Indonesia tax office in pursuit of certain aspects of the original framework for resolution. During 2019, in conjunction with the framework for resolution, PT-FI recorded net charges totaling $304 million, including $123 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income, net, $78 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net and $103 million to provision for income tax expense, primarily for the impact of a reduction in the statutory rate on PT-FI’s deferred tax assets. During 2020 , in connection with progress of the framework for resolution, PT-FI recorded additional net charges of $46 million, including $9 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income, net and $35 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $2 million to provision for income tax expense. During 2021, mostly in connection with the October 2021 meeting with the Indonesia tax office and the progress of the framework for resolution, PT-FI recorded total additional net charges of $384 million, including $155 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income, net, $43 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, net, and $186 million to provision for income tax expense. Peru Tax Matters. SUNAT (National Superintendency of Customs and Administration), the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute. In December 2016, the Peru parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent, and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects it to a stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. Chile Tax Matters . In September 2014, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chile operations was subject to an effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chile operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019 and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chile legislature so that the 35 percent rate continued through 2021, increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter. In January 2020, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that would further delay the 44.5 percent rate until 2027 and thereafter. In 2010, the Chile legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023 mining royalty rates at FCX’s El Abra mine are based on a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other (expense) income, net rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows. The balance at year-end December 31, 2019, was revised by $115 million and the balance at year-end December 31, 2020, was revised by $179 million to adjust for amounts paid on accruals not yet settled.

============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $620 million at December 31, 2021, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with cost recovery methods and royalties and other related mining taxes, and $307 million at December 31, 2020, and $339 million at December 31, 2019. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $808 million at December 31, 2021, included $694 million ($465 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current and prior-year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX's tax treatment of cost recovery methods. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2022, FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2021, FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 24 U.S. states. The aggregate environmental obligation for approximately 60 percent of the active remediation projects totaled less than $20 million at December 31, 2021. A summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis. b. Adjustments to environmental obligations that do not provide future economic benefits are charged to operating income. Adjustments primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments. Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $89 million in 2022, $80 million in 2023, $105 million in 2024, $98 million in 2025, $100 million in 2026 and $3.2 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2021, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.7 billion, including $1.5 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and de-escalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.7 billion. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis. At December 31, 2021, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and four other companies (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) and the City of New York entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify remedial options. The NCG’s RI/FS work and efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. The NCG submitted a final draft RI report in October 2021, which is currently under review by EPA. The NCG expects to submit a draft FS report to EPA in late 2025 and currently expects EPA to select a creek-wide remedy in 2026, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. In July 2019, the NCG entered into an AOC with EPA to conduct a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the first two miles of the creek to support an evaluation of an early interim remedy for that section of the creek. In July 2021, EPA terminated the FFS, which effectively means remediation of the lower creek will be performed at the same time as the site-wide remedy. FCX’s environmental liability balance for the creek was $318 million at December 31, 2021. The final costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. Changes to the overall cost of this remedial obligation and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX established an environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation. Assessments of sediments in the adjacent Arthur Kill and sampling and analysis within the offsite area as we obtain access to residential properties are ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. The extent of contamination and potential remedial actions are uncertain and may take several years to evaluate. On January 30, 2017, a putative class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending, and FMC was added as a defendant. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants on-site and off-site through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for economic losses, including diminished property values, additional soil investigation and remediation and other damages. In January 2020, the parties completed briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The judge indicated in late 2021 that the plaintiffs may submit rebuttal expert reports, which will likely result in additional discovery and refiling of a new briefing on class certification. This will likely delay the court’s decision on class certification. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. Under the terms of the Consent Decree executed in May 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. In 2020, FCX reduced its associated obligation and recorded a $47 million credit to operating income to reflect the discounting effect of the recent and expected pace of project work under post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions. By letter dated September 29, 2021, EPA also informed an FCX subsidiary that it does not expect to have funds sufficient to remediate sites covered by a bankruptcy settlement with Tronox and EPA considers a subsidiary of FCX to be potentially liable for 23 of these sites. FCX is also conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on approximately 15,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. A similar agreement is in place with the U.S. Forest Service for mine features on U.S. Forest Service land. Either BLM or the U.S Forest Service may request additional assessment or remediation activities for other claims with mining features. FCX will update this obligation when it has a sufficient number of remedy decisions from the BLM or the U.S Forest Service to support a reasonably certain range of outcomes. FCX expects it will take several years to complete this work. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $2,472 $2,505 $2,547 Liabilities incurred 2 7 20 Settlements and revisions to cash flow estimates, net 331 a (13) (5) Accretion expense 112 131 118 Dispositions — (2) (5) Spending (201) (156) (170) Balance at end of year 2,716 2,472 2,505 Less current portion (200) (268) (330) Long-term portion $2,516 $2,204 $2,175
============================================================

a. Includes an adjustment at PT-FI totaling $397 million, see further discussion below. ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2021, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.5 billion, of which $0.9 billion was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2021, FCX had trust assets totaling $208 million (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $424 million. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. In 2020, the agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments and completed a permit renewal for Chino. In 2021, the agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments, and completed a permit renewal for Tyrone. At December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $510 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the ADEQ. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards during operations and closure. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the implementation cost, with a more detailed closure plan required at the time operations cease. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. Closure costs for facilities covered by APPs are required to be updated every six years and financial assurance mechanisms are required to be updated every two years. Morenci’s APP requires updated stockpile reclamation plans in 2022, which are expected to result in increased closure costs. Bagdad’s APP also requires an updated cost estimate for its closure plan in 2022, which is expected to result in increased closure costs. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Bagdad according to a schedule to be determined by ADEQ. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $363 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. In March 2020, the Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) approved Henderson’s proposed update to its closure plan and closure cost estimate. As of December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $153 million for its Colorado operations. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. In accordance with its permit from DRMS, Climax will submit an updated reclamation plan and cost estimate in 2024. Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Chile Mining and Geology Agency. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, El Abra submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval of the updated closure plan and cost estimates was received in August 2020, and did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $82 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in 2017 Cerro Verde submitted its closure plan and cost estimate updated for the mine expansion, which was approved in February 2018. At December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $141 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities under the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. The construction time frame for reclamation of the West Wanagon overburden stockpile has been extended from 2025 to 2029 because safety constraints for working in steep and difficult terrain has reduced labor and equipment operating efficiencies. The time frame extension resulted in longer and escalating fixed costs, combined with additional anticipated volumes of stockpile material to be moved. As a result of the change in estimated costs, an ARO adjustment of $397 million was recorded in 2021, with $340 million charged to production and delivery costs, as it relates to the depleted Grasberg open pit. At December 31, 2021, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $1.1 billion for its PT-FI operations. Indonesia government regulations issued in 2010 require a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of its special mining license (IUPK), submitted a revised mine closure plan to Indonesia’s Department of Energy and Mineral Resources to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At December 31, 2021, PT-FI had restricted time deposits totaling $113 million for mine closure and reclamation guarantees. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). As of December 31, 2021, FM O&G AROs cover 135 wells and approximately 100 platforms and other structures and it had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $337 million. Litigation. In addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and above under “Environmental,” we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and not required to be disclosed, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. SEC regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any current pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants, along with numerous co-defendants, in 13 cases out of a total of 42 cases filed in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulfur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, through the Attorney General and separately through the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. Specifically, the cases alleged the defendants failed to obtain and/or comply with required coastal use permits in violation of the Louisiana State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, and sought unspecified damages for the alleged statutory violations, and restoration of the properties at issue to their original condition. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in two of the five cases that had been set for trial, both originally filed on November 8, 2013: Parish of Plaquemines v. ConocoPhillips Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-982, Div. B and Parish of Plaquemines v. Hilcorp Energy Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-999, Div. B. In 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all 13 cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be $23.5 million with the initial payment of $15 million to be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The initial payment will be held in trust and later deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) if the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund. The settlement agreement will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of $4.25 million beginning in 2023 provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of those annual installments are conditioned only on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, but all subsequent installments are also conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, resulting in the $23.5 million maximum total payment obligation. The settlement agreement must be executed by all parties, including authorized representatives of the six south Louisiana parishes originally plaintiffs in the suit and certain other non-plaintiff Louisiana parishes and the state of Louisiana. The agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. FCX recorded a charge in 2019 for the initial payment of $15 million, which will be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement has been executed by the FCX affiliates, several of the Louisiana parishes, and the state of Louisiana. FCX is continuing its efforts to obtain signatures from or on behalf of the remaining parishes to finalize the settlement. Upon execution of the settlement agreement by all parties, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all 13 pending cases. Asbestos and Talc Claims . Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining and processing from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. In accordance with the terms of the 1992 transactions and subsequent agreements, Imerys undertook the defense and indemnification of Cyprus Mines and CAMC in talc lawsuits. Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which has historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations and took responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, in February 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys stopped defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys took the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access could be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently on hold. On December 22, 2020, Imerys filed an amended bankruptcy plan disclosing a global settlement with Cyprus Mines and CAMC, which provides a framework for a full and comprehensive resolution of all current and future potential liabilities arising out of the Cyprus Mines talc business, including claims against FCX, its affiliates, Cyprus Mines, and CAMC. In 2021, Imerys obtained an injunction temporarily staying approximately 950 talc-related lawsuits against CAMC and Cyprus Mines, which has been extended through June 2022. The interim stay is a component of the global settlement but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will continue to impose the interim stay. On January 23, 2021, Imerys filed the form of a settlement and release agreement to be entered into by CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX, Imerys and the other debtors, tort claimants’ committee and future claims representative in the Imerys bankruptcy. In accordance with the global settlement, among other things, (1) CAMC will pay a total of $130 million in cash to a settlement trust in seven annual installments, which will be guaranteed by FCX; (2) CAMC and Cyprus Mines and their affiliates will contribute to the settlement trust all rights that they have to the proceeds of certain legacy insurance policies as well as indemnity rights they have against Johnson & Johnson, and (3) Cyprus Mines will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with CAMC paying expenses of Cyprus Mines’ bankruptcy process, subject to certain limitations. On February 11, 2021, Cyprus Mines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In connection with executing the settlement and release agreement, FCX concluded that it has a probable loss and, in 2020, recorded a $130 million charge to environmental obligations and shutdown costs. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced it established a new subsidiary to hold and manage its cosmetic talc liabilities, which entity subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This filing could further slow and complicate FCX’s efforts to implement a resolution. FCX’s global settlement is subject to, among other things, votes by claimants in both the Imerys and Cyprus Mines bankruptcy cases as well as bankruptcy court approvals in both cases, and there can be no assurance that the global settlement will be successfully implemented. FCX has a $130 million liability balance at December 31, 2021, associated with the proposed settlement. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period from December 2006 to December 2013. No royalty assessments can be issued for the years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15-year stability agreement. Cerro Verde contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying under protest the disputed assessments mostly under installment payment programs provided under Peruvian law. During 2021, Cerro Verde made payments totaling $421 million, which was the balance of its royalty dispute liabilities. On February 28, 2020, FCX filed on its own behalf and on behalf of Cerro Verde international arbitration proceedings against the Government of Peru under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The hearing on the merits is scheduled to take place in May 2023. In April 2020, SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V., another shareholder of Cerro Verde, filed another international arbitration proceeding against the Government of Peru under the Netherlands-Peru Bilateral Investment Treaty. The hearing on the merits is scheduled to take place in February 2023. Other Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalties and Interest Total 2003 to 2008 $48 $130 $178 2009 56 52 108 2010 54 122 176 2011 and 2012 41 72 113 2013 48 65 113 2014 to 2016 5 28 33 $252 $469 $721
============================================================

As of December 31, 2021, Cerro Verde had paid $642 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $405 million, resulting in a net receivable of $237 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. Cerro Verde’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021, of which $0.3 billion has not been recorded. Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesia government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments, including potential penalties follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalties and Interest Total 2005 $62 $30 $92 2007 48 23 71 2008 and 2011 28 36 64 2012 and 2013 41 43 84 2014 and 2015 121 — 121 2016 257 483 740 2017 and 2019 48 47 95 $605 $662 $1,267
============================================================

As of December 31, 2021, PT-FI had paid $278 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $221 million, resulting in a net receivable of $57 million (included in other assets). PT-FI’s income tax assessments, penalties and interest included in the table above totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, of which $0.5 billion has not been recorded. Surface Water Taxes . PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. As a result, PT-FI offered to pay one trillion rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged $69 million to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In May 2019, PT-FI agreed to a final settlement of 1.394 trillion rupiah (approximately $99 million) and recorded an incremental charge of $28 million. PT-FI paid 708.5 billion rupiah ($50 million) in October 2019, and paid the balance of 685.5 billion rupiah ($48 million) during 2021. Export Duty Matter . In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesia government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former contract of work (COW) would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement and agreed to continue to pay export duties of 5 percent on copper concentrate export sales until completion of the divestment and new IUPK. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5 percent export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations. PT-FI paid $155 million for these duties under protest and appealed the disputed amounts to the Indonesia Tax Court. The Indonesia Tax Court subsequently ruled in favor of PT-FI related to the cases involving $29 million of the disputed amounts, which were refunded by the Indonesia Customs Office to PT-FI. The Indonesia Customs Office appealed the Indonesia Tax Court decisions on these cases to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 29, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website rulings unfavorable to PT-FI for certain of the appealed cases involving approximately half of the $29 million that had been refunded to PT-FI. As a result of the October 2019 ruling, FCX recorded a charge of $155 million in 2019 to fully reserve for this matter. Withholding Tax Assessments . In January 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in November 2017. PT-FI currently has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total $47 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021), including penalties and interest. Smelter Development Progress . As a result of COVID-19 mitigation measures, there have been disruptions to work and travel schedules of international contractors and restrictions on access to the proposed physical site of the greenfield smelter in Gresik, Indonesia. PT-FI continues to discuss with the Indonesia government a deferred schedule for the greenfield smelter in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of PT-FI’s commitment for the development of additional smelting capacity in Indonesia under the terms of its IUPK. On January 7, 2021, the Indonesia government levied an administrative fine of $149 million for the period from March 30, 2020, through September 30, 2020, on PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter as of July 31, 2020. On January 13, 2021, PT-FI responded to the Indonesia government objecting to the fine because of events outside of its control causing a delay of the greenfield smelter’s development progress. PT-FI believes that its communications during 2020 with the Indonesia government were not properly considered before the administrative fine was levied. In June 2021, the Indonesia government issued a ministerial decree for the calculation of an administrative fine for lack of smelter development in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, PT-FI recorded charges totaling $16 million for a potential settlement of the administrative fine. On January 25, 2022, the Indonesia government submitted a new estimate of the administrative fine totaling $57 million. On February 15, 2022, PT-FI responded to the Indonesia government with a revised calculation of $37 million. PT-FI expects to record a charge in the first quarter of 2022 for an amount in excess of the previously recorded $16 million. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $239 million at December 31, 2021, primarily associated with environmental obligations, AROs and for copper concentrate shipments from PT-FI to Atlantic Copper as required by Indonesia regulations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $492 million at December 31, 2021, primarily associated with environmental obligations and AROs. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2021, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $62 million, which consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $51 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $26 million (a current portion of $7 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $19 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incidental to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Leases. Effective January 1, 2019, FCX adopted the new Accounting Standards Update (ASU) for lease accounting, and nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU. FCX leases various types of properties, including land, offices and equipment under non-cancelable leases. The components of FCX’s leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31 follow:

Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2021, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $4.3 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($3.1 billion), transportation services ($0.4 billion) and electricity ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $1.6 billion in 2022, $1.5 billion in 2023, $0.5 billion in 2024, $0.2 billion in 2025, $0.2 billion in 2026 and $0.3 billion thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. IUPK - Indonesia. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the development of additional smelting capacity in Indonesia by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested due to COVID-19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the Indonesia government, refer to Note 12), and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041, assuming the additional extension is received. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $319 million in 2021, $160 million in 2020 and $106 million in 2019. Dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX totaled $1.0 billion in 2021 and are subject to a 10 percent withholding tax. There were no dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX in 2020 or 2019. The IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia exceeds 50 percent. PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled $218 million in 2021, $92 million in 2020 and $66 million in 2019 (excluding $155 million associated with the historical export duty matter discussed in Note 12). The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, which began in 2019 and are recognized in production and delivery costs. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesia government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond to support its commitment to construct a greenfield smelter in Indonesia ($132 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2021). In March 2021, PT-FI received a one-year extension of its export license through March 15, 2022. In December 2021, PT Smelting received a twelve-month extension of its anodes slimes export license, which expires December 9, 2022, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months. Chiyoda Contract. In July 2021, PT-FI awarded a construction contract to Chiyoda for the construction of a greenfield smelter in Gresik, Indonesia with an estimated contract cost of $2.8 billion. During 2021, PT-FI progressed site preparation activities and expects engineering procurement and construction activities to advance during 2022 and 2023. Construction of the greenfield smelter is expected to be completed as soon as feasible in 2024, which is subject to no additional COVID-19-related disruptions and other factors. PT-FI Tolling Agreement. PT-FI entered into a tolling agreement with PT Smelting that will be effective January 1, 2023, and will replace the current concentrate sales agreements between PT-FI and PT Smelting. Under the tolling agreement, PT-FI will pay PT Smelting to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title to all products for sale to third parties. Indemnification. The PT-FI divestment agreement, discussed in Note 3, provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. FCX had accrued $78 million as of December 31, 2021, and $42 million as of December 31, 2020, (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) related to this indemnification. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. Throughout 2019, PT-FI consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the Partnership Fund in compliance with PT-FI’s IUPK. Throughout the restructuring process, PT-FI continued its contributions to ensure no disruptions in implementation of approved projects. Beginning in February 2020, the Partnership Fund is managed by a legally-recognized Indonesia foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK). PT-FI charged $75 million in 2021, $36 million in 2020 and $28 million in 2019 to cost of sales for this commitment. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. In April 2020, FCX entered into forward sales contracts for 150 million pounds of copper for settlement in May and June of 2020. The forward sales provided for fixed pricing of $2.34 per pound of copper on approximately 60 percent of North America's sales volumes for May and June 2020. These contracts resulted in hedging losses totaling $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no remaining forward sales contracts after June 30, 2020 . A discussion of FCX’s other derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments - Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod and cathode customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 78 million pounds at an average contract price of $4.30 per pound, with maturities through October 2023. A summary of gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized gains (losses) on the related hedged item follows (in millions):

============================================================

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and the London gold prices as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price and the London gold price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2021, follows:

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in production and delivery costs. At December 31, 2021, Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for 2 million pounds at an average contract price of $4.53 per pound, with maturities through March 2022.

============================================================

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $77 million. Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2021, and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2020), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2021, FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values). Trade Accounts Receivable Agreements. In first-quarter 2021, PT-FI entered into agreements to sell certain trade accounts receivables to unrelated third-party financial institutions. The agreements were entered into in the normal course of business to fund the working capital for the additional quantity of copper to be supplied by PT-FI to PT Smelting. The balances sold under the agreements were excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of PT-FI and its creditors, (ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) PT-FI has no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables. In addition, PT-FI provides no other forms of continued financial support to the purchaser of the receivables once the receivables are sold. Gross amounts sold under these arrangements totaled $431 million in 2021. Discounts on the sold receivables totaled $2 million in 2021. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):

NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2021. FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

Refer to Note 14 for further discussion and balance sheet classifications. d. Recorded at cost except for debt assumed in acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value at the respective acquisition dates. Valuation Techniques. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. In December 2016, FCX’s sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties included up to $150 million in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration is being received over time as future cash flows are realized from a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform, with the related payments commencing in third-quarter 2018. The contingent consideration included in (i) other current assets totaled $20 million at December 31, 2021, and $12 million at December 31, 2020, and (ii) other assets totaled $70 million at December 31, 2021, and $96 million at December 31, 2020. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is primarily valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2021, as compared to those techniques used at December 31, 2020. A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer. Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 14 percent of FCX’s consolidated revenues in 2021, 12 percent in 2020 and 13 percent in 2019, and they are the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2021. Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $1.4 billion in 2021, $0.9 billion in 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019, and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $3.1 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2021, approximately 31 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 14 percent was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2022. In February 2022, PT-FI completed negotiations with its unions on a new two-year collective bargaining agreement that is effective through March 2024. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other segments, including Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining and on PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting (on 25.0 percent prior to April 30, 2021, and 39.5 percent thereafter) until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star), Bagdad, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. During 2021, the Morenci mine produced 43 percent of FCX’s North America copper and 16 percent of FCX’s consolidated copper production. South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. During 2021, the Cerro Verde mine produced 85 percent of FCX’s South America copper and 23 percent of FCX’s consolidated copper production. Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. During 2021, PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district produced 35 percent of FCX’s consolidated copper production and 99 percent of FCX’s consolidated gold production. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode and rod. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2021, Atlantic Copper purchased 18 percent of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 7 percent from FCX’s South America mining operations and 9 percent from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items, which include the Miami smelter, Freeport Cobalt (until the sale of it in September 2021), molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, the greenfield smelter and PMR in Indonesia, certain non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee and Tohono in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

NOTE 17. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2021, have been prepared using industry accepted practice and conform to the disclosure requirements under Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. FCX’s proven and probable mineral reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry. Mineral reserves, as used in the reserve data presented here, mean an estimate of tonnage and grade of measured and indicated mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. Proven mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. To classify an estimate as a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must possess a high degree of confidence of tonnage, grade and quality. Probable mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of an indicated or, in some cases, a measured mineral resource. The qualified person’s level of confidence will be lower in determining a probable mineral reserve than it would be in determining a proven mineral reserve. To classify an estimate as a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person’s confidence must still be sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable considering reasonable investment and market assumptions. FCX’s mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2021, were determined using metals price assumptions of $2.50 per pound for copper, $1,200 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, LME copper settlement prices averaged $3.25 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $1,654 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $11.97 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries, where applicable.

============================================================

a. Estimated consolidated recoverable copper reserves included 1.8 billion pounds in leach stockpiles and 0.3 billion pounds in mill stockpiles. b. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through 2041. As a result, PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Note 13 for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK). As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, PT-FI expects to mine 48 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at December 31, 2021, representing 53 percent of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 55 percent of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable gold reserves. c. Consolidated mineral reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves of 346 million ounces of silver, which were determined using $15 per ounce. d. May not foot because of rounding. e. Net equity interest mineral reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note 3 for further discussion of FCX’s ownership in subsidiaries). FCX's net equity interest for estimated metal quantities in Indonesia reflects approximately 81 percent for 2022 and 48.76 percent from 2023 through 2041. Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves of 230 million ounces of silver.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 16, 2021 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s operations are in certain taxing jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex income tax regulations. The Company has disclosed uncertain tax positions related to income tax assessments in Indonesia and Peru totaling $1.7 billion, including penalties and interest, which have not been recorded at December 31, 2020. The Company recognizes a liability for income tax assessments when it is more likely than not that it will not sustain the benefit taken or expected to be taken in the tax return.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Because of the complexity of tax laws, regulations and contractual agreements with the applicable government, auditing the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our tax professionals.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluated third-party tax or legal opinions obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Note 12 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $1.6 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to evaluate whether an environmental loss has been incurred and to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, the duration and effectiveness of the chosen remedial strategy, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated.

============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental loss contingency calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingencies. To test the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s models and tested the significant assumptions discussed above along with the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We utilized our environmental specialists to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2020, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 percent-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20 percent, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other (expense) income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains totaled $34 million in 2020, $24 million in 2019 and $14 million in 2018. Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia; and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds. Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, SX/EW, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for all of its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional payment is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income (loss) per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive. Reconciliations of net income (loss) and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

a. Excludes approximately 11 million shares of common stock in 2019 and 1 million in 2018 associated with outstanding stock options with exercise prices less than the average market price of FCX’s common stock and RSUs that were anti-dilutive. Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock. Stock options for 31 million shares of common stock in 2020, 42 million shares in 2019 and 37 million shares in 2018 were excluded. New Accounting Standards. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) that requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model, which requires consideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications. For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications relate to a revision to FCX’s presentation of business segments to remove a business segment that no longer qualifies as a reportable segment (refer to Note 16), as well as, reclassification of certain costs from selling, general and administrative expenses to production and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations in 2019 ($20 million) and 2018 ($21 million). Subsequent Events. FCX evaluated events after December 31, 2020, and through the date the financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these financial statements. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Pursuant to the previously announced divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum, also known as MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired for cash consideration of $3.85 billion all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 percent of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which at the time owned 9.36 percent of PT-FI. Of the $3.85 billion in cash consideration, Rio Tinto received $3.5 billion and FCX received $350 million. In addition, Rio Tinto paid FCX $107 million for its share of the 2018 joint venture cash flows. In connection with the transaction, an aggregate 40 percent share ownership in PT-FI was issued to PT Inalum and PTI (which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua). Based on a subscription of PT Inalum’s rights to acquire for cash consideration of $3.5 billion all of Rio Tinto’s interests in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of the entity (PT Rio Tinto Indonesia) that held Rio Tinto’s interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (26.24 percent) and PTI’s (25.00 percent) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 percent and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 percent. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent from 2019 through 2022. The divestment agreement provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued $42 million (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020) related to this indemnification. FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX has concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitles FCX to approximately 81 percent of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining 19 percent paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI’s net income for 2020 totaled $765 million, of which $621 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s net loss for 2019 totaled $203 million, of which $165 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s cumulative net income since December 21, 2018, through December 31, 2020, totaled $425 million, of which $346 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI has not paid dividends during the Initial Period. The above-described attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss applies only through the Initial Period. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss will be based on equity ownership percentages (48.76 percent for FCX, 26.24 percent for PT Inalum and 25.00 percent for PTI). For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Kisanfu Transaction. In December 2020, FCX completed the sale of its interests in the Kisanfu undeveloped project to a wholly owned subsidiary of China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $550 million, with after-tax net cash proceeds totaling $415 million. The Kisanfu project, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is an undeveloped cobalt and copper resource. As of December 31, 2019, FCX did not have any proven and probable reserves associated with the Kisanfu project. FCX recorded a gain of $486 million in 2020 associated with this transaction. Cobalt Business. In fourth-quarter 2019, FCX completed the sale of its cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and related cobalt cathode precursor business (consisting of approximately $271 million of assets and $63 million of liabilities at the time of closing) to Umicore for total cash consideration of approximately $200 million, including approximately $50 million of working capital. Under the terms of the agreement, FCX separated its cobalt business, and Umicore acquired the refinery and cathode precursor business. FCX and the current noncontrolling interest partners in Freeport Cobalt retained the remaining cobalt business, which is a producer of cobalt fine powders, chemicals, catalysts, ceramics and pigments. Lundin Mining Corporation, one of the noncontrolling interest partners, received 30 percent of the proceeds from this transaction. FCX recorded a gain of $59 million in 2019 associated with this transaction. Timok Transaction. In 2016, FCX sold an interest in the upper zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia (the 2016 Transaction). In December 2019, FCX completed the sale of its interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project to an affiliate of the purchaser in the 2016 Transaction, for cash consideration of $240 million at closing plus the right to future contingent payments of up to $150 million. These future contingent payments will be based on the future sale of products (as defined in the agreement) from the Timok lower zone. For a period of 12 months after the third anniversary of the initial sale of products from the Timok lower zone, the purchaser can settle, or FCX can demand payment of, such deferred payment obligation, in each case, for a total of $60 million. As these deferred payments are contingent upon future production (the Timok project is still in the exploration phase) and would result in gain recognition, no amounts were recorded upon the closing of the transaction. Subsequent recognition will be based on the gain contingency model, in which the consideration would be recorded in the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. This is expected to be when FCX (i) is provided periodic product sales information by the purchaser or (ii) gives notice to the purchaser or receives notice from the purchaser regarding the settlement of the deferred payments for $60 million. In addition, in lieu of such payment upon achievement of defined development milestones, the purchaser agreed to pay the $107 million contingent consideration provided for in the 2016 Transaction in three installment payments of $45 million by July 31, 2020 (which was collected in 2020), $50 million by December 31, 2021, and $12 million by March 31, 2022. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of $343 million, consisting of the cash consideration ($240 million) and the aggregate discounted amount of the three installment payments ($103 million). Oil and Gas Operations. In 2016, FCX sold the majority of its oil and gas assets held by its wholly owned subsidiary, FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G). In 2019, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of $36 million (before closing adjustments), which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $20 million. In 2018, FM O&G disposed of certain property interests that resulted in the recognition of a gain of $27 million, primarily associated with the abandonment obligations that were assumed by the acquirer. TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its 70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to COMC for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeded $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeded $20 per pound, both during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration was considered a derivative, and the fair value was adjusted through December 31, 2019. FCX realized and collected in January 2020 contingent consideration of $60 million because the average cobalt price exceeded $20 per pound during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019 (no amount was realized associated with the copper price), and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. Gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative totaling $3 million in 2019 and $(17) million in 2018 were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt and copper prices. In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results from TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations. Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations of $3 million in 2019 and $(15) million in 2018 in the consolidated statements of operations, primarily includes gains (losses) associated with the change in the fair value of contingent consideration. NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and molybdenum, with mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2020, FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FCX has a 72 percent interest in Morenci (refer to “Joint Ventures – Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100 percent of the other North America mines. At December 31, 2020, operating mines in South America were Cerro Verde (53.56 percent owned) located in Peru and El Abra (51 percent owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 2020, FMC’s net assets totaled $15.0 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $15.7 billion. FCX had no loans outstanding to FMC at December 31, 2020. FCX’s direct share ownership in PT-FI totaled 81.28 percent through December 21, 2018, and 48.76 percent thereafter. PTI owned 9.36 percent of PT-FI and FCX owned 100 percent of PTI through December 21, 2018. Refer to Note 2 for a discussion of the PT-FI divestment. Refer to “Joint Ventures - Former Rio Tinto Joint Venture” for discussion of PT-FI’s unincorporated joint venture. At December 31, 2020, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $11.4 billion and its retained earnings totaled $7.2 billion. FCX had $539 million in intercompany loans to PT-FI outstanding at December 31, 2020. FCX owns 100 percent of the outstanding Atlantic Copper common stock. At December 31, 2020, Atlantic Copper’s net assets totaled $145 million and its accumulated deficit totaled $406 million. FCX had $56 million in intercompany loans to Atlantic Copper outstanding at December 31, 2020. Joint Ventures. FCX has the following unincorporated joint ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. FMC owns a 72 percent undivided interest in Morenci via an unincorporated joint venture. The remaining 28 percent is owned by Sumitomo (15 percent) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13 percent). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. FMC purchased 146 million pounds of Morenci’s copper cathode from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. at market prices for $409 million during 2020. FMC had receivables from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. totaling $15 million at December 31, 2020, and $19 million at December 31, 2019. Former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. On December 21, 2018, PT-FI acquired Rio Tinto’s interest in the joint venture and is consolidating 100 percent of the Indonesia operations (refer to Note 2 for discussion of the PT-FI divestment). Pursuant to Rio Tinto’s previous joint venture agreement with PT-FI, Rio Tinto had a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2022 in Block A of PT-FI’s former Contract of Work (COW), and, after 2022, a 40 percent interest in all production from Block A.

============================================================

Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, FCX had no borrowings outstanding and $10 million in letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion could be used for additional letters of credit. Availability under FCX’s revolving credit facility consists of $3.28 billion maturing April 2024 and $220 million maturing April 2023. For PT-FI, $500 million of the revolving credit facility is available. FCX’s revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants and representations, and also contains a number of negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of FCX’s subsidiaries that are not borrowers or guarantors to incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) and FCX’s or its subsidiaries’ abilities to: create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in mergers, liquidations and dissolutions; and sell assets. FCX’s revolving credit facility also contains financial ratios governing maximum total leverage and minimum interest expense coverage. In June 2020, FCX, PT-FI and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G LLC) amended the $3.5 billion, unsecured revolving credit facility. The key changes under the amendment include (i) suspension of the total leverage ratio (ratio of total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the credit agreement) through June 30, 2021, followed by a limit of 5.25 x beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2021, and stepping down to 3.75 x beginning January 1, 2022; and (ii) a reduction in the interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement) to a minimum of 2.00 x through December 31, 2021, reverting to 2.25 x beginning January 1, 2022. FCX also agreed to a minimum liquidity covenant of $1 billion (consisting of consolidated unrestricted cash and availability under the revolving credit facility) applicable to each quarter through June 30, 2021, and additional restrictions on priority debt and liens, and the payment of common stock dividends through December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, FCX was in compliance with all of its covenants. As further discussed in Note 10, in February 2021, the FCX Board of Directors (the Board) reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock. Prior to the Board’s declaration of the initial quarterly dividend, FCX will deliver a covenant reversion notice, at which time the financial covenants and other restrictions, including the dividend restriction, will revert to the limits applicable prior to the June 2020 amendment. Interest on loans made under the revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings. Certain of FCX’s debt agreements, including our revolving credit facility, reference LIBOR and other interbank offered rates, which are being phased out and replaced with alternative reference rates. FCX does not expect the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. Cerro Verde Term Loan. Repayments of the Cerro Verde Term Loan totaled $305 million in 2020, $200 million in 2019 and $470 million in 2018, with the remaining balance of $525 million due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. Interest under the Term Loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s Term Loan was 2.05 percent at December 31, 2020. FCX recorded net losses of $1 million in 2020, $1 million in 2019 and $3 million in 2018, associated with Cerro Verde’s prepayments on its Term Loan. Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans. In December 2014, Cerro Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its shareholders for borrowings up to $800 million. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and availability under these agreements totals $200 million at December 31, 2020. Senior Notes. In July 2020, FCX completed the sale of $650 million of 4.375 % Senior Notes due 2028 and $850 million of 4.625 % Senior Notes due 2030 for proceeds, net of underwriting fees, totaling $1.485 billion. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. FCX used $1.4 billion of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase a portion of its outstanding 3.55 % Senior Notes due 2022, 3.875 % Senior Notes due 2023 and 4.55 % Senior Notes due 2024, and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. The remaining net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes. In March 2020, FCX completed the sale of $700 million of 4.125 % Senior Notes due 2028 and $600 million of 4.25 % Senior Notes due 2030 for proceeds, net of underwriting fees, totaling $1.285 billion. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. FCX used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase a portion of its 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and its 3.55 % Senior Notes due 2022 and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. In April 2020, FCX used the remaining net proceeds to fund the make-whole redemption of all of its remaining 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with the transaction. In August 2019, FCX sold $600 million of 5.00 % Senior Notes due 2027 and $600 million of 5.25 % Senior Notes due 2029 for total net proceeds of $1.187 billion. Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. FCX used the net proceeds from this offering to fund the make-whole redemption of all of its outstanding 6.875 % Senior Notes due 2023, and the concurrent tender offers to purchase a portion of its 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and its 3.55 % Senior Notes due 2022, and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, FCX redeemed in full or purchased a portion of the following senior notes.

a. Refer to Note 7 for current portion. b. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering some U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. See below for discussion of a 2020 plan amendment. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes the periodic development of asset allocation studies and review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment committee considers these studies in the formal establishment of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s investment objective emphasizes diversification through both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various asset classes and the selection of investment managers whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager, is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset allocation approximates 40 percent equity investments (primarily developed market equities), 52 percent fixed income (primarily long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt securities) and 8 percent alternative investments (private real estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 5.25 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2021, which was based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments for service to date together with the Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Yield Curve - Above Mean consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which the participant completed 25 years of credited service. The annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 14,034 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2020, and 13,832 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2019. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7.75 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2021. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for qualified and non-qualified plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

============================================================

a. Employer contributions for 2021 are expected to approximate $64 million for the FCX plans and $2 million for the PT-FI plan (based on a December 31, 2020, exchange rate of 14,034 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar). In August 2020, the FMC Retirement Plan, the largest FMC plan, was amended such that, effective September 1, 2020, participants no longer accrue any additional benefits under the FMC Retirement Plan. As a result, FCX remeasured its pension assets and benefit obligation as of July 31, 2020. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets used for the July 31, 2020, remeasurement were 2.40 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively. The rate of compensation increase was unchanged (3.25 percent). The remeasurement and curtailment resulted in the projected benefit obligation increasing by $184 million and plan assets increasing by $103 million. In addition, FCX recognized a curtailment loss of $4 million in third-quarter 2020. During 2020, the actuarial loss of $308 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 3.40 percent to 2.50 percent, offset by the FMC Retirement Plan amendment to discontinue additional benefits . During 2019, the actuarial loss of $328 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 4.40 percent to 3.40 percent. During 2020, the actuarial loss of $12 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 7.25 percent to 6.25 percent. During 2019, the actuarial gain of $27 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from a change in the estimated plan administration costs, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from 8.25 percent to 7.25 percent. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s pension plans for the years ended December 31 follow:

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to prices derived using significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to prices derived using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) require up to a 15-calendar-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash. Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

a. Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits. Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

a. Based on a December 31, 2020, exchange rate of 14,034 Indonesia rupiah to one U.S. dollar. Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $69 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2020, and a current portion of $13 million and a long-term portion of $112 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in the benefit obligation from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, is primarily a result of a plan amendment that modified the benefit for most medicare eligible retirees effective January 1, 2021. The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for these plans, which was determined on the same basis as FCX’s pension plans, was 2.21 percent at December 31, 2020, and 3.00 percent at December 31, 2019. Expected benefit payments for these plans total $8 million for 2021, $7 million for 2022, $7 million for 2023, $6 million for 2024, $6 million for 2025 and $23 million for 2026 through 2030 . The net periodic benefit cost charged to operations for FCX’s postretirement benefits (primarily for interest costs) totaled $3 million in 2020, $4 million in 2019 and $5 million in 2018. The discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s postretirement benefits was 3.00 percent in 2020, 4.20 percent in 2019 and 3.50 percent in 2018. The medical-care trend rates assumed the first year trend rate was 7.50 percent at December 31, 2020, which declines over the next 15 years with an ultimate trend rate of 4.25 percent. FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $6 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $42 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2020, and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $44 million at December 31, 2019. FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with specified guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options. FCX contributes to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $49 million at December 31, 2020, and $46 million at December 31, 2019, all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans totaled $40 million in 2020, $85 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2018. The decrease in costs for 2020, compared with 2019, resulted from a temporary suspension of FCX contributions to certain plans implemented as part of its April 2020 revised operating plans. FCX contributions resumed on January 1, 2021. FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Common Stock. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global economic uncertainties, the Board suspended FCX’s quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. In February 2021, the Board reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock at an annual rate of $0.30 per share. The Board also adopted a new financial policy for the allocation of cash flows aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining a strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. Under the new policy, up to 50 percent of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interests would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects. The new payout policy will be implemented following achievement of a net debt (total consolidated debt less total consolidated cash and cash equivalents) target in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding project debt for additional smelter capacity in Indonesia. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board and will be assessed on an ongoing basis, taking into account FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, global economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2020, 39.7 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans. Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options granted prior to 2018 generally vest in 25 percent annual increments; beginning in 2018, awards granted vest in 33 percent annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. A summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, follows:

============================================================

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the annual dividend at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. Information related to stock options during the years ended December 31 follows:

As of December 31, 2020, FCX had $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years. Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after three years . The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.5 million for 2018, 0.7 million for 2019 and 0.8 million for 2020, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/- up to 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

As of December 31, 2020, FCX had $10 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.6 years. Cash-Settled RSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2020, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.6 billion that will expire between 2021 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of $7.0 billion that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, of that balance approximately $305 million can be carried forward indefinitely, (iii) U.S. state net operating losses of $10.8 billion that primarily expire between 2021 and 2040, (iv) Spanish net operating losses of $559 million that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesia net operating losses of $910 million that expire between 2021 and 2025. Valuation Allowance. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2020, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more- likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.7 billion at December 31, 2020, and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2019, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state net operating losses. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses totaled $2.4 billion and other deferred tax assets totaled $647 million at December 31, 2020. Net operating losses and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or net operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented. The $156 million net increase in the valuation allowances during 2020 primarily related to increases totaling $250 million in U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, partly offset by an $11 million decrease in U.S. deferred tax assets for which no benefit is expected to be realized, and a $75 million decrease in U.S foreign tax credits associated with expirations. Other Events. In connection with the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, governments throughout the world are announcing measures that are intended to provide tax and other financial relief. Such measures include the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020. None of these measures resulted in material impacts to FCX’s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, certain provisions of the CARES Act provided FCX with the opportunity to accelerate collections of tax refunds, primarily those associated with the U.S. AMT. FCX collected U.S. AMT credit refunds of $244 million in 2020. FCX expects to collect an additional $24 million within the next 12 months. FCX continues to evaluate income tax accounting considerations of COVID-19 measures as they develop, including any impact on its measurement of existing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. FCX will recognize any impact from COVID-19 related changes to tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to a 25 percent corporate income tax rate and a 10 percent profits tax on net income beginning in 2019. As a result of the change in statutory tax rate applicable to deferred income tax liabilities, during fourth-quarter 2018, FCX recognized a tax credit of $504 million. In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 31, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During the fourth quarter of 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters. On December 30, 2019, PT-FI made a payment of $250 million based on its understanding of the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of the tax years 2012 through 2016, as well as tax years 2017 (for which a tax audit is not complete), 2018 (for which a tax audit has not begun) and 2019 (for which an audit has just begun). Additional administrative steps will need to be completed by both PT-FI and the Indonesia Tax Office in order to implement the resolution. In 2019, in conjunction with the framework for resolution above, PT-FI recorded total net charges in 2019 of $304 million, including $123 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other income (expense), net, $78 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense and $103 million to provision for income tax expense, primarily for the impact of a reduction in the statutory rate on PT-FI’s deferred tax assets. During fourth-quarter 2020, in connection with progress of the framework for resolution, PT-FI recorded additional net charges of $42 million, including $9 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other income (expense), net and $35 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense, partly offset by a benefit of $2 million to provision for income tax expense. SUNAT (National Superintendency of Customs and Administration), the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute and net charges recorded in 2017 through 2019. In December 2016, the Peru parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from 4.1 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent, and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. In September 2014, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chile operations was subject to an effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chile operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019 and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chile legislature so that the 35 percent rate continues through 2021 increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter. In January 2020, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that would further delay the 44.5 percent rate until 2027 and thereafter. In 2010, the Chile legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were 4 percent for the years 2013 through 2017. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023, rates moved to a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income (expense), net rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE

============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets was $163 million at December 31, 2020, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and other related mining taxes, and $231 million at December 31, 2019, and $186 million at December 31, 2018. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $295 million at December 31, 2020, included $254 million ($168 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with non-deductible service costs, royalties and other related mining taxes and cost recovery methods. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX’s tax treatment of social welfare payments and cost recovery methods. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2021, FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2020, FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 24 U.S. states. A summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

============================================================

a. Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis. b. Adjustments to environmental obligations that do not provide future economic benefits are charged to operating income. Reductions primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments. Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $83 million in 2021, $95 million in 2022, $100 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024, $100 million in 2025 and $3.2 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2020, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.6 billion, including $1.5 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and de-escalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.7 billion. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion on an undiscounted and unescalated basis. At December 31, 2020, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial options. The parties ’ RI/FS work under the AOC and their efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. The NCG submitted the initial draft RI to EPA in 2016 and currently expects the report to be finalized in 2021. The NCG currently anticipates a draft FS to be submitted to EPA for review and approval in 2024. EPA is not expected to propose a final creek-wide remedy until after the RI/FS is completed, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. In July 2019, the NCG entered into an AOC to conduct a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the first two miles of the creek to support an evaluation of an interim remedy for that section of the creek (Early Action). A draft FFS was submitted to EPA in December 2019, and an EPA decision on the Early Action is currently expected in late 2021. The actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the Early Action, the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX established an environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation. Additional sampling and analysis is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. The extent of contamination and potential remedial actions are uncertain and may take several years to evaluate. On January 30, 2017, a putative class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending, and FMC was added as a defendant. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants on-site and off-site through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for economic losses, including diminished property values, additional soil investigation and remediation and other damages. In January 2020, the parties completed briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and are awaiting a decision by the court. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. Under the terms of the Consent Decree executed on May 22, 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. In 2020, FCX reduced its associated obligation and recorded a $47 million credit to operating income to reflect the discounting effect of the recent and expected pace of project work under post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions. FCX is also conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on approximately 15,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. BLM may request additional assessment or reclamation activities for other claims with mining features. FCX will update this obligation when it has a sufficient number of remedy decisions from the BLM to support a reasonably certain range of outcomes. FCX expects it will take several years to complete this work. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2020 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $2,505 $2,547 $2,583 Liabilities incurred 7 20 1 Settlements and revisions to cash flow estimates, net (13) (5) 50 Accretion expense 131 118 110 Dispositions (2) (5) (37) Spending (156) (170) (160) Balance at end of year 2,472 2,505 2,547 Less current portion (268) (330) (317) Long-term portion $2,204 $2,175 $2,230
============================================================

ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2020, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.5 billion, of which $860 million was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2020, FCX had trust assets totaling $212 million (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $469 million. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. In 2020, the agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments and completed a permit renewal for Chino. FCX expects permit renewals and updated financial assurance instruments for Tyrone to be finalized during in 2021. At December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $477 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the ADEQ. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards during operations and closure. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the implementation cost, with a more detailed closure plan required at the time operations cease. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. Closure costs for facilities covered by APPs are required to be updated every six years and financial assurance mechanisms are required to be updated every two years. Morenci’s APP requires updated stockpile reclamation plans by 2022, which will result in increased closure costs. Bagdad’s APP also requires an updated cost estimate for its closure plan in 2022. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Bagdad according to a schedule to be determined by ADEQ. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $362 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. In December 2019, Henderson submitted an updated closure plan, which resulted in increased closure costs. In March 2020, the Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) approved Henderson’s proposed update to its closure plan and closure cost estimate. As of December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $138 million for its Colorado operations. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. In accordance with its permit from DRMS, Climax will submit an updated reclamation plan and cost estimate in 2024. Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Chile Mining and Geology Agency. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, El Abra submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval of the updated closure plan and cost estimates was received on August 12, 2020, and did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $81 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the five-year closure plan and cost update required by the Mine Closure Law, the latest closure plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion were submitted in 2017 and approved in February 2018. At December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $138 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities under the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. At December 31, 2020, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $827 million for its PT-FI operations. Indonesia government regulations issued in 2010 require a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of the IUPK, submitted a revised mine closure plan to Indonesia’s Department of Energy and Mineral Resources to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At December 31, 2020, PT-FI had restricted time deposits for mine closure guarantees ($94 million) and reclamation guarantees ($2 million). In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) notified PT-FI of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the MOEF indicated were not reflected in PT-FI’s environmental permit. The MOEF also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, and tailings management. In December 2018, the MOEF issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. The remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and, in a few situations, PT-FI has agreed with the MOEF on an appropriate multi-year work plan, including the closure of an overburden stockpile. In addition, PT-FI continues to work with MOEF to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands. In December 2018, PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large-scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The MOEF issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by PT-FI that would target continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant long-term costs to PT-FI’s operations. The new framework enables PT-FI to maintain compliance with site-specific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the MOEF. In 2018, PT-FI recorded a $32 million charge for MOEF assessments of prior period permit fees. In 2020, the final settlement for these permit fees totaled $13 million and PT-FI recorded a credit of $19 million. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). As of December 31, 2020, FM O&G AROs cover approximately 165 wells and 120 platforms and other structures and it had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $410 million. Litigation. In addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and above under “Environmental”, we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and not required to be disclosed, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. SEC regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any current pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants, along with numerous co-defendants, in 13 cases out of a total of 42 cases filed in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulphur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, through the Attorney General and separately through the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. Specifically, the cases alleged the defendants failed to obtain and/or comply with required coastal use permits in violation of the Louisiana State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, and sought unspecified damages for the alleged statutory violations, and restoration of the properties at issue to their original condition. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in two of the five cases that had been set for trial, both originally filed on November 8, 2013: Parish of Plaquemines v. ConocoPhillips Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-982, Div. B and Parish of Plaquemines v. Hilcorp Energy Company et al. , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-999, Div. B. In 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all 13 cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be $23.5 million with the initial payment of $15 million to be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The initial payment will be held in trust and later deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) once the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund. The settlement agreement will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of $4.25 million beginning in 2023 provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of those annual installments are conditioned only on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, but all subsequent installments are also conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, resulting in the $23.5 million maximum total payment obligation. The settlement agreement must be executed by all parties, including authorized representatives of the six south Louisiana parishes originally plaintiffs in the suit and certain other non-plaintiff Louisiana parishes and the state of Louisiana. The agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. FCX recorded a charge in 2019 for the initial payment of $15 million, which will be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement has been executed by the FCX affiliates and several of the Louisiana parishes. FCX expects the agreement to be executed by all parties; however, execution has been delayed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, fall 2020 elections and changes to the administrative structure developed by the Louisiana parishes. Upon execution of the settlement agreement by all parties, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all 13 pending cases. Asbestos and Talc Claims . Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining and processing from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. In accordance with the terms of the 1992 transactions and subsequent agreements, Imerys undertook the defense and indemnification of Cyprus Mines and CAMC in talc lawsuits. Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which has historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations and took responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, on February 13, 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys stopped defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys took the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In late March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access could be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently on hold. FCX recorded legal defense and settlement costs associated with talc-related litigation totaling approximately $24 million for the year 2020 and $28 million for the year 2019. Multiple trials previously scheduled during 2020 were postponed because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Postponed cases may be reset prior to the adversary proceeding regarding the legacy insurance, which is currently on hold. On December 22, 2020, Imerys filed an amended bankruptcy plan disclosing a global settlement with Cyprus Mines and CAMC, which provides a framework for a full and comprehensive resolution of all current and future potential liabilities arising out of the Cyprus Mines talc business, including claims against FCX, its affiliates, Cyprus Mines, and CAMC. On January 21 2021, Imerys sought an injunction temporarily staying approximately 950 talc-related lawsuits against CAMC and Cyprus Mines and the bankruptcy court is expected to rule on the injunction in February 2021. The interim stay is a component of the global settlement but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will impose the interim stay. On January 23, 2021, Imerys filed the form of a settlement and release agreement to be entered into by CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX, Imerys and the other debtors, tort claimants’ committee and future claims representative in the Imerys bankruptcy. In accordance with the global settlement, among other things, (1) CAMC will pay a total of $130 million in cash to a settlement trust in seven annual installments, which will be guaranteed by FCX; (2) CAMC and Cyprus Mines and their affiliates will contribute to the settlement trust all rights that they have to the proceeds of certain legacy insurance policies as well as indemnity rights they have against Johnson & Johnson, and (3) Cyprus Mines will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with CAMC paying expenses of Cyprus Mines’ bankruptcy process. On February 11, 2021, Cyprus Mines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FCX has concluded that it has a probable loss and recorded a $130 million charge to environmental obligations and shutdown costs in 2020. The global settlement is subject to, among other things, bankruptcy court approvals of both the Imerys bankruptcy plan and the Cyprus Mines bankruptcy plan, and there can be no assurance that the global settlement will be successfully implemented. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2013. No assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15-year stability agreement. Cerro Verde contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for the period from December 2006 through December 2013 under installment payment programs provided under Peru law. Through December 31, 2020, Cerro Verde has paid $477 million under these installment payment programs. In October 2017, the Peru Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were proper under Peru law. As a result of the unfavorable Peru Supreme Court ruling, Cerro Verde recorded net charges in 2017. In September 2018, the Peru Tax Tribunal denied Cerro Verde’s request to waive penalties and interest, primarily associated with the disputed assessments for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In December 2018, Cerro Verde elected not to appeal the Peru Tax Tribunal’s decisions, and as a result, recorded net charges for these amounts in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, Cerro Verde had recorded all of its exposure associated with disputed royalties for prior years with the Peru tax authorities. Cumulative charges to net income recorded during the three years ended December 31, 2019, totaled $388 million. Any future recoveries would be recorded when collected. A summary of the charges recorded for the three-years ended December 31, 2019, related to the Cerro Verde royalty dispute follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Royalty and related assessment charges: 2019 2018 a 2017 Total Production and delivery $6 $14 $203 b $223 Interest expense, net 10 370 145 525 Other expense — 22 — 22 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (2) (35) 7 c (30) Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (7) (176) (169) (352) $7 $195 $186 $388
============================================================

a. Amounts are net of gains of $16 million (consisting of pre-tax gains of $14 million and net tax benefits of $17 million, net of $15 million in noncontrolling interests) for refunds received for the overpayment of special (voluntary) levies for the period October 2012 through the year 2013. b. Includes $175 million related to disputed royalty assessments for the period from December 2006 to September 2011 (when royalties were determined based on revenues). c. Includes tax charges of $136 million for disputed royalties ($69 million) and other related mining taxes ($67 million) for the period October 2011 through the year 2013 when royalties were determined based on operating income, mostly offset by a tax benefit of $129 million associated with disputed royalties and other related mining taxes for the period December 2006 through December 2013. Cerro Verde has also recorded other interest charges associated with royalty matters, including installment payment programs, totaling $44 million in 2020 and $58 million in 2019. On February 28, 2020, FCX filed on its own behalf and on behalf of Cerro Verde international arbitration proceedings against the Peru government. In April 2020, SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V., another shareholder of Cerro Verde, filed a parallel arbitration proceeding under a different investment treaty against the Peru government. Other Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Penalty and Interest Assessment Total 2003 to 2008 $50 $129 $179 2009 56 52 108 2010 54 118 172 2011 and 2012 42 78 120 2013 48 66 114 2014 to 2020 45 — 45 $295 $443 $738
============================================================

As of December 31, 2020, Cerro Verde had paid $433 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $243 million, resulting in a net receivable of $190 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water and withholding tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesia government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Interest Assessment Total 2005 $62 $30 $92 2007 48 23 71 2008, 2010 to 2011 31 8 39 2012 97 — 97 2013 152 76 228 2014 123 — 123 2015 159 — 159 2016 257 113 370 2017 40 19 59 $969 $269 $1,238
============================================================

As of December 31, 2020, PT-FI had paid $143 million (included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which it believes is collectible. Surface Water Taxes . PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. As a result, PT-FI offered to pay one trillion rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged $69 million to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In May 2019, PT-FI agreed to a final settlement of 1.394 trillion rupiah (approximately $99 million) and recorded an incremental charge of $28 million. PT-FI paid 708.5 billion rupiah ($50 million) in October 2019, and will pay the balance of 685.5 billion rupiah ($49 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2020, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020) in 2021. Export Duty Matter . In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesia government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former COW would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement and agreed to continue to pay export duties of 5 percent on copper concentrate export sales until completion of the divestment and new IUPK. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5 percent export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations. PT-FI paid $155 million under protest during the period April 2017 and December 21, 2018, and appealed the disputed amounts to the Indonesia Tax Court. The Indonesia Tax Court subsequently ruled in favor of PT-FI related to the cases involving $29 million of the disputed amounts, which were refunded by the Indonesia Customs Office to PT-FI. The Indonesia Customs Office appealed the Indonesia Tax Court decisions on these cases to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 29, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website rulings unfavorable to PT-FI for certain of the appealed cases involving approximately half of the $29 million that had been refunded to PT-FI. As a result of the October 2019 ruling, FCX recorded a charge of $155 million in 2019 to fully reserve for this matter. PT-FI continues to believe that a five percent export duty was applicable during this period and is evaluating options to recover these overpayments. Withholding Tax Assessments . In January 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in November 2017 and has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total approximately $47 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2020, and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020), including penalties and interest. As a result of the January 2019 ruling, PT-FI concluded a loss on all outstanding withholding tax matters is probable under applicable accounting guidance, and it recorded a charge of $61 million in 2018. For information regarding PT-FI mine development cost tax matters, refer to Note 11. Smelter Development Progress . As a result of COVID-19 mitigation measures, there have been disruptions to work and travel schedules of international contractors and restrictions on access to the proposed physical site of the new smelter in Gresik, Indonesia. PT-FI continues to discuss with the Indonesia government a deferred schedule for the new smelter project as well as other alternatives in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and volatile global economic conditions. On January 7, 2021, the Indonesia government levied an administrative fine of $149 million for the period from March 30, 2020, through September 30, 2020 (additional fines could be levied on exports after September 30, 2020), on PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on the new smelter as of July 31, 2020. On January 13, 2021, PT-FI responded to the Indonesia government objecting to the fine because of events outside of its control causing a delay of the new smelter’s development progress. PT-FI believes that its communications during 2020 with the Indonesia government were not properly considered before the administrative fine was levied. PT-FI and its legal counsel believe, upon consideration of all the facts, PT-FI is not obligated to pay the fine and, therefore, it has not recorded an accrual for this loss contingency. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $671 million at December 31, 2020, primarily for environmental and AROs, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $437 million at December 31, 2020, primarily associated with environmental and AROs. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2020, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $50 million, which consisted of a current portion of $9 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $41 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $14 million (a current portion of $5 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $9 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Leases. Effective January 1, 2019, FCX adopted the new ASU for lease accounting. FCX leases various types of properties, including offices and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU. The components of FCX’s leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
December 31, 2020 2019 Lease right-of-use assets (included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, net) $207 $232 Short-term lease liabilities (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) $38 $44 Long-term lease liabilities (included in other liabilities) 190 204 Total lease liabilities $228 $248
============================================================

Operating lease costs, primarily included in production and delivery expense in the consolidated statement of operations, for the two years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
2020 2019 Operating leases $42 $55 Variable and short-term leases 74 $79 Total operating lease costs $116 $134
============================================================

Prior to the adoption of the new ASU, lease costs totaled $80 million in 2018 (FCX elected the practical expedient not to adjust that year). FCX paid $40 million during 2020 and $43 million in 2019 for lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet (primarily included in operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows). As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities was 5.4 percent (5.5 percent as of December 31, 2019) and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 7.7 years (8.2 years as of December 31, 2019). The future minimum payments for leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020, follow:

============================================================

Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2020, based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $4.2 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($2.9 billion), cobalt ($516 million), electricity ($301 million) and transportation services ($209 million). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $1.8 billion in 2021, $1.2 billion in 2022, $539 million in 2023, $334 million in 2024, $119 million in 2025 and $253 million thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. Special Mining License (IUPK) - Indonesia. As discussed in Note 2, on December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $160 million in 2020, $106 million in 2019 and $238 million in 2018. Dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX are subject to a 10 percent withholding tax. The IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter progress exceeds 50 percent. PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties for the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled $92 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019 (excluding $155 million associated with the historical export duty matter as discussed in Note 12), and $180 million in 2018. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019, which are recognized in production and delivery costs as incurred. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesia government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond at that time to support its commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia ($148 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2020). In March 2020, PT-FI received a one-year extension of its export license through March 15, 2021. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. Throughout 2019, PT-FI consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the Partnership Fund in compliance with PT-FI’s IUPK. Throughout the restructuring process, PT-FI continued its contributions to ensure no disruptions in implementation of approved projects. Beginning in February 2020, the Partnership Fund is managed by a legally-recognized Indonesian foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK). PT-FI charged $36 million in 2020, $28 million in 2019 and $55 million in 2018 to cost of sales for this commitment. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. In April 2020, FCX entered into forward sales contracts for 150 million pounds of copper for settlement in May and June of 2020. The forward sales provided for fixed pricing of $2.34 per pound of copper on approximately 60 percent of North America's sales volumes for May and June 2020. These contracts resulted in hedging losses totaling $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no remaining forward sales contracts after June 30, 2020 . A discussion of FCX’s other derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the three years ended December 31, 2020, resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2020, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 50 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.21 per pound, with maturities through December 2022. A summary of gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized gains (losses) on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and London gold prices as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price and the London gold price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2020, follows:

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in production and delivery costs. At December 31, 2020, Atlantic Copper held net copper forward purchase contracts for 6 million pounds at an average contract price of $3.56 per pound, with maturities through February 2021.

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances.

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $186 million. Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of $0.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2020, FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values). Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2020. FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

a. Current portion included in other current assets and long-term portion included in other assets. b. Excludes time deposits (which approximated fair value) included in (i) other current assets of $97 million at December 31, 2020, and $100 million at December 31, 2019, and (ii) other assets of $148 million at December 31, 2020, and $157 million at December 31, 2019, primarily associated with an assurance bond to support PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia (refer to Note 13 for further discussion) and PT-FI’s closure and reclamation guarantees (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). c. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion and balance sheet classifications. d. Recorded at cost except for debt assumed in acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value at the respective acquisition dates. Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its onshore California oil and gas properties, which included contingent consideration of up to $150 million, consisting of $50 million per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over $70 per barrel in each of these calendar years. No contingent consideration was realized in 2020 or 2019 because the average Brent crude oil price did not exceeded $70 per barrel for either year. Contingent consideration of $50 million was realized in 2018 and collected in first-quarter 2019 (included in proceeds from sales of assets in the consolidated statements of cash flows) because the average Brent crude oil price exceeded $70 per barrel for 2018. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative was $11 million (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) at December 31, 2019. The fair value at December 31, 2019, was calculated based on average commodity price forecasts through the applicable maturity date using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The model used various observable inputs, including Brent crude oil forward prices, volatilities and discount rates. As a result, this contingent consideration asset was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In December 2016, FCX’s sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties included up to $150 million in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration will be received over time as future cash flows are realized in connection from a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform, with the related payments commencing in third-quarter 2018. The contingent consideration included in (i) other current assets totaled $12 million at December 31, 2020, and $18 million at December 31, 2019, and (ii) other assets totaled $96 million at December 31, 2020, and $104 million at December 31, 2019. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is primarily valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2020, as compared to those techniques used at December 31, 2019. A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer. Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 12 percent of FCX’s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, 13 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 12 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2020. Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $0.9 billion in 2020, $1.0 billion in 2019 and $1.2 billion in 2018, and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $1.8 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2020, approximately 38 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 16 percent was covered by agreements that expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire within one year. In December 2020, PT-FI signed a new agreement with one union effective April 2020 through March 2022, giving all employees the option to reject the new stipulations, but no employees have rejected the agreement. Another union filed a lawsuit in November 2020 regarding the new agreement, and the pending decision could modify the agreement. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. At year-end 2020, FCX’s Bagdad mine did not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment. As a result, FCX revised its segment disclosure for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, to conform with the current year presentation. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other segments, including Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining, and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting, until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced 50 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2020. South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro Verde mine produced 84 percent of FCX’s South America copper during 2020. Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2020, Atlantic Copper purchased 10 percent of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 7 percent from FCX’s South America mining operations and 4 percent from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items. Other mining includes the Miami smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), Freeport Cobalt, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been estimated as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2020, were determined using metals price assumptions of $2.50 per pound for copper, $1,200 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, LME copper settlement prices averaged $2.83 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $1,477 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $10.65 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated February 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 14, 2020 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s operations are in certain taxing jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex income tax regulations. The Company has disclosed uncertain tax positions related to income tax assessments in Indonesia and Peru totaling $1.7 billion, including penalties and interest, which have not been recorded at December 31, 2019. The Company recognizes a liability for income tax assessments when it is more likely than not that it will not sustain the benefit taken or expected to be taken in the tax return.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Because of the complexity of tax laws, regulations and contractual agreements with the applicable government, auditing the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our tax professionals.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluated third-party tax or legal opinions obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Note 12 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $1.6 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to evaluate whether an environmental loss has been incurred and to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the nature and extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, the duration and effectiveness of the chosen remedial strategy, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental loss contingency calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental loss contingencies. To test the Company’s identification and measurement of the environmental loss contingencies, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s model and tested the significant assumptions discussed above along with the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We utilized our environmental specialists to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Freeport-McMoRan inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 percent -owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20 percent , and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Bagdad, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other (expense) income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains (losses) totaled $24 million in 2019 , $14 million in 2018 and $(5) million in 2017 . Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia; and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations, and customs duty taxes. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of time deposits and money market funds. Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, SX/EW, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for all of its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional payment is made upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold settlement prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average LBMA gold settlement price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net (loss) income per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net (loss) income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive. Reconciliations of net (loss) income and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net (loss) income per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock. Stock options for 42 million shares of common stock in 2019 , 37 million shares in 2018 and 41 million shares in 2017 were excluded. New Accounting Standards. Following is a discussion of new accounting standards. Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. FCX adopted this ASU effective December 31, 2019, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments. In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model, which requires consideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019, and elected the practical expedients allowing it to (i) apply the provisions of the updated lease guidance at the effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented and (ii) not reassess lease contracts, lease classification and initial direct costs of leases existing at adoption. FCX also elected an accounting policy to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and a purchase option that is not expected to be exercised. Nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU. Adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of $243 million in lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019. Reclassifications. For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications relate to a change in methodology for determining current leach stockpiles (refer to Note 4) and a revision to FCX’s presentation of business segments to include a new reportable segment (refer to Note 16). NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Pursuant to the previously announced divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired for cash consideration of $3.85 billion all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 percent of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which at the time owned 9.36 percent of PT-FI. Of the $3.85 billion in cash consideration, Rio Tinto received $3.5 billion and FCX received $350 million . In addition, Rio Tinto paid FCX $107 million for its share of the 2018 joint venture cash flows. In connection with the transaction, an aggregate 40 percent share ownership in PT-FI was issued to PT Inalum and PTI (which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua). Based on a subscription of PT Inalum’s rights to acquire for cash consideration of $3.5 billion all of Rio Tinto’s interests in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of the entity (PT Rio Tinto Indonesia) that held Rio Tinto’s interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (26.24 percent) and PTI’s (25.00 percent) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 percent and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 percent . The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent from 2019 through 2022. The divestment agreement provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. As of December 31, 2019, FCX had accrued $33 million (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019) related to this indemnification. FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. FCX also analyzed PT-FI’s acquisition of the Rio Tinto Joint Venture interests and concluded the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in mineral reserves and related long-lived mining assets. The acquisition was a single asset because substantially all of the acquired assets are linked to each other and cannot be physically removed without causing a significant diminution to the fair value of the other assets. PT-FI allocated the $3.5 billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair value estimates were based on, but not limited to, long-term metal price assumptions of $3.00 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold; expected future cash flows based on estimated reserve quantities; costs to produce and develop the related reserves; current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets; and appropriate discount rates using an estimated international cost of capital of 14 percent . The estimates were primarily based on significant inputs not observable in the market (as discussed above) and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:

The following table summarizes the consolidated impact of the transaction discussed above on FCX’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 21, 2018:

============================================================
a. Primarily reflects the approximate 40 percent economic interest in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture for the period from 2023 through 2041, which was acquired by PTI and PT Inalum.
============================================================

FCX considered if the adjustment to capital in excess of par value was an indicator of impairment and after considering other factors, such as PT-FI’s historical results and projected undiscounted cash flows, concluded that it did not indicate a potential impairment at PT-FI. Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX has concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on the economics replacement agreement, as previously discussed. The economics replacement agreement entitles FCX to approximately 81 percent of PT-FI dividends paid during the Initial Period, with the remaining 19 percent paid to the noncontrolling interests. PT-FI’s net loss for 2019 totaled $203 million , of which $165 million was attributed to FCX. PT-FI’s cumulative net loss since December 21, 2018, through December 31, 2019, totaled $339 million , of which $276 million was attributed to FCX. The above-described attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss applies only through the Initial Period. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss will be based on equity ownership percentages (48.76 percent for FCX, 26.24 percent for PT Inalum and 25.00 percent for PTI). For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Cobalt Business. In fourth-quarter 2019 , FCX completed the sale of its cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and related cobalt cathode precursor business (consisting of approximately $271 million of assets and $63 million of liabilities at the time of closing) to Umicore for total cash consideration of approximately $200 million , including approximately $50 million of working capital. Under the terms of the agreement, FCX separated its cobalt business, and Umicore acquired the refinery and cathode precursor business. FCX and the current noncontrolling interest partners in Freeport Cobalt will retain the remaining cobalt business, which is a producer of cobalt fine powders, chemicals, catalysts, ceramics and pigments. Lundin Mining Corporation, one of the noncontrolling interest partners, received 30 percent of the proceeds from this transaction. FCX recorded a gain of $59 million in 2019 associated with this transaction. Timok Transaction. In 2016, FCX sold an interest in the upper zone of the Timok exploration project in Serbia (the 2016 Transaction). In December 2019, FCX completed the sale of its interest in the lower zone of the Timok exploration project to an affiliate of the purchaser in the 2016 Transaction, for cash consideration of $240 million at closing plus the right to future contingent payments of up to $150 million . These future contingent payments will be based on the future sale of products (as defined in the agreement) from the Timok lower zone. For a period of 12 months after the third anniversary of the initial sale of products from the Timok lower zone, the purchaser can settle, or FCX can demand payment of, such deferred payment obligation, in each case, for a total of $60 million . As these deferred payments are contingent upon future production (the Timok project is still in the exploration phase) and would result in gain recognition, no amounts were recorded upon the closing of the transaction. Subsequent recognition will be based on the gain contingency model, in which the consideration would be recorded in the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. This is expected to be when FCX (i) is provided periodic product sales information by the purchaser or (ii) gives notice to the purchaser or receives notice from the purchaser regarding the settlement of the deferred payments for $60 million . In addition, in lieu of such payment upon achievement of defined development milestones, the purchaser agreed to pay the $107 million contingent consideration provided for in the 2016 Transaction in three installment payments of $45 million by July 31, 2020, $50 million by December 31, 2021, and $12 million by March 31, 2022. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of $343 million , consisting of the cash consideration ($240 million) and the aggregate discounted amount of the three installment payments ($103 million). Oil and Gas Operations. In 2016, FCX sold the majority of its oil and gas assets held by its wholly owned subsidiary, FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G). In 2019, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of $36 million (before closing adjustments), which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $20 million . In 2018, FM O&G disposed of certain property interests that resulted in the recognition of a gain of $27 million , primarily associated with the abandonment obligations that were assumed by the acquirer. In 2017, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of $80 million (before closing adjustments), which resulted in the recognition of gains of $49 million . TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. In November 2016, FCX completed the sale of its 70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound, both during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration was considered a derivative, and the fair value was adjusted through December 31, 2019. FCX realized and collected in January 2020 contingent consideration of $60 million because the average cobalt price exceeded $20 per pound during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2019 (no amount was realized associated with the copper price), and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative was $57 million at December 31, 2018 (included in other assets). Gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative totaling $3 million in 2019, $(17) million in 2018 and $61 million in 2017 were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt and copper prices. In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results from TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:

============================================================

Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had no borrowings outstanding and $13 million in letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately $3.5 billion , of which approximately $1.5 billion could be used for additional letters of credit. For PT-FI, $500 million of the revolving credit facility is available. In May 2019, FCX, PT-FI and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G LLC) amended the $3.5 billion , five -year, unsecured revolving credit facility to extend $3.26 billion of the facility by one year to April 20, 2024, with the remaining $240 million maturing on April 20, 2023. In November 2019, the revolving credit facility was amended to allow flexibility during ongoing transition to underground mining at Grasberg. The November 2019 amendment modified (i) the total leverage ratio from 3.75 x to 5.25 x through June 30, 2021 and (ii) the calculation of the total debt component used to determine the total leverage ratio by adjusting the amount of unrestricted cash that may be applied to reduce the amount of total debt from $2.5 billion to $1.25 billion through June 30, 2021. Interest on loans made under the new revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings. Cerro Verde Credit Facility. In March 2014, Cerro Verde entered into a five -year, $1.8 billion senior unsecured credit facility that is nonrecourse to FCX and the other shareholders of Cerro Verde. In June 2017, Cerro Verde’s credit facility was amended (balance outstanding at the time of amendment was $1.275 billion) to increase the commitment by $225 million to $1.5 billion , to modify the amortization schedule and to extend the maturity date to June 19, 2022. The amended credit facility amortizes in four installments, with $225 million due on December 31, 2020 (which was fully prepaid during 2018), $225 million due on June 30, 2021 (which was fully prepaid during 2018), $525 million due on December 31, 2021 (of which $200 million was prepaid during 2019 and $20 million was prepaid during 2018), and the remaining balance due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. All other terms, including the interest rates, remain the same. Interest under the term loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s credit facility was 3.70 percent at December 31, 2019. Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans. In December 2014, Cerro Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its shareholders for borrowings up to $800 million . No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and availability under these agreements totals $200 million at December 31, 2019 . Senior Notes issued by FCX. In August 2019, FCX sold $600 million of 5.00 % Senior Notes due 2027 and $600 million of 5.25 % Senior Notes due 2029 for total net proceeds of $1.187 billion . Interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. FCX used the net proceeds from this offering to fund the make-whole redemption of all of its outstanding 6.875 % Senior Notes due 2023, and the concurrent tender offers to purchase a portion of its 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 and its 3.55 % Senior Notes due 2022, and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in connection with these transactions. The 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2021 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price. The 5.00 % Senior Notes due 2027 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to September 1, 2022, and at specified redemption prices thereafter. The 5.25 % Senior Notes due 2029 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to September 1, 2024, and at specified redemption prices thereafter. The senior notes listed below are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to the dates stated below, and beginning on the dates stated below at 100 percent of principal.

Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes the periodic development of asset allocation studies and review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment committee considers these studies in the formal establishment of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s investment objective emphasizes diversification through both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various asset classes and the selection of investment managers whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager, is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset allocation approximates 42 percent equity investments (primarily global equities), 50 percent fixed income (primarily long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt securities) and 8 percent alternative investments (private real estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 6.25 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2020, which was based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments for service to date together with the Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which the participant completed 25 years of credited service. The annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 13,832 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2019 , and 14,409 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2018 . Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7.75 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2020. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Mercer Indonesia zero coupon bond yield curve derived from the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for those plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

============================================================

During 2019, the actuarial loss of $328 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 4.40 percent to 3.40 percent . During 2018, the actuarial gain of $124 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 3.70 percent to 4.40 percent ($205 million), partially offset by new census data incorporated into the valuations ($33 million) and updated demographic assumptions ($49 million) mainly resulting from mortality updates. During 2019, the actuarial gain of $27 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from a change in estimated plan administration costs, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from 8.25 percent to 7.25 percent . During 2018, the actuarial gain of $19 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 6.75 percent to 8.25 percent and demographic experience gains.

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) require up to a 15-calendar-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash. Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $13 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $112 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2019 , and a current portion of $13 million and a long-term portion of $115 million at December 31, 2018 . The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for these plans, which was determined on the same basis as FCX’s pension plans, was 3.00 percent at December 31, 2019 , and 4.20 percent at December 31, 2018 . Expected benefit payments for these plans total $13 million for 2020 , $12 million for 2021 , $11 million for 2022 , $11 million for 2023 , $10 million for 2024 and $42 million for 2025 through 2029 . The net periodic benefit cost charged to operations for FCX’s postretirement benefits (primarily for interest costs) totaled $4 million in 2019 and $5 million in each of 2018 and 2017 . The discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s postretirement benefits was 4.20 percent in 2019 , 3.50 percent in 2018 and 3.80 percent in 2017 . The medical-care trend rates assumed the first year trend rate was 7.75 percent at December 31, 2019 , which declines over the next 15 years with an ultimate trend rate of 4.25 percent . FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $44 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2019 , and a current portion of $6 million and a long-term portion of $39 million at December 31, 2018 . FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options. FCX contributes to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of employee pre-tax deferral contributions up to certain limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $46 million at December 31, 2019 , and $45 million at December 31, 2018 , all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans totaled $85 million in 2019 , $75 million in 2018 and $65 million in 2017 . FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. Restructuring Charges. As a result of the first-quarter 2017 regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding long-term investment stability, PT-FI took actions to adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and slow investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. These actions included workforce reductions through furlough and voluntary retirement programs. Following the furlough and voluntary retirement programs, a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under the existing Indonesia laws and regulations. As a result, PT-FI recorded charges in 2017 to production costs of $120 million , and selling, general and administrative costs of $5 million for employee severance and related costs, and a pension curtailment loss of $4 million in production costs. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Common Stock. In February 2018, FCX’s Board of Directors (the Board) reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock at an annual rate of $0.20 per share. On December 18, 2019, FCX declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, which was paid on February 3, 2020, to common stockholders of record as of January 15, 2020. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board and will depend on FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options granted prior to 2018 generally vest in 25 percent annual increments; beginning in 2018, awards granted vest in 33 percent annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control.

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the annual dividend (excluding supplemental dividends) at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option.

As of December 31, 2019 , FCX had $23 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years. Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers received annual grants of PSUs that vest after three years . For the PSUs granted in 2017, the total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.6 million , of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 175 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial and operating metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. For the PSUs granted in 2018 and 2019, the total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.5 million for 2018 and 0.7 million for 2019, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group. All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests. A summary of outstanding stock-settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2019 , and activity during the year ended December 31, 2019 , follows:

============================================================
============================================================

The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs granted was $24 million during 2019 , $41 million during 2018 and $32 million during 2017 . The total intrinsic value of stock-settled RSUs vested was $26 million during 2019 , $14 million during 2018 and $45 million during 2017 . As of December 31, 2019 , FCX had $13 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.7 years. Cash-Settled RSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these cash-settled RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The cash-settled RSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

The total grant-date fair value of cash-settled RSUs was $10 million during 2019 , $16 million during 2018 and $10 million during 2017 . The intrinsic value of cash-settled RSUs vested was $8 million during 2019 , $11 million during 2018 and $24 million during 2017 . The accrued liability associated with cash-settled RSUs consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $3 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2019 , and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $3 million at December 31, 2018 .

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.7 billion that will expire between 2020 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of $5.9 billion that primarily expire between 2036 and 2037, (iii) U.S. state net operating losses of $10.8 billion that primarily expire between 2020 and 2039, (iv) Spanish net operating losses of $516 million that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesia net operating losses of $1.2 billion that expire between 2020 and 2027. Valuation Allowance. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2019 , including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more- likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2019 , and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2018 , and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state net operating losses. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019 . FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses totaled $2.2 billion and foreign deferred tax assets totaled $671 million at December 31, 2019 . Net operating losses and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or net operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented. The $69 million net increase in the valuation allowances during 2019 primarily related to increases totaling $208 million in U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which no benefit is expected to be realized, partly offset by a $98 million decrease in U.S. foreign tax credits associated with expirations and prior year adjustments, and a $44 million decrease in U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Other Events. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to a 25 percent corporate income tax rate and a 10 percent profits tax on net income beginning in 2019. As a result of the change in statutory tax rate applicable to deferred income tax liabilities, during fourth-quarter 2018, FCX recognized a tax credit of $504 million . In 2018, PT-FI received unfavorable Indonesia Tax Court decisions with respect to its appeal of capitalized mine development costs on its 2012 and 2014 corporate income tax returns. PT-FI appealed those decisions to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 31, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court communicated an unfavorable ruling regarding the treatment of mine development costs on PT-FI’s 2014 tax return. During the fourth quarter of 2019, PT-FI met with the Indonesia Tax Office and developed a framework for resolution of the disputed matters. On December 30, 2019, PT-FI made a payment of $250 million based on its understanding of the framework for resolution of disputes arising from the audits of the tax years 2012 through 2016, as well as tax years 2017 (for which a tax audit is not complete) and 2018 (for which a tax audit has not begun). Additional administrative steps will need to be completed by both PT-FI and the Indonesia Tax Office in order to implement the resolution. In conjunction with the framework for resolution above, PT-FI recorded total net charges of $304 million , including $123 million for non-deductible penalties recorded to other (expense) income, $78 million for non-deductible interest recorded to interest expense and $103 million to provision for income tax expense, primarily for the impact of a reduction in the statutory rate on PT-FI’s deferred tax assets. SUNAT, the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute and net charges recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017. In December 2016, the Peru parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from 4.1 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent , and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent . Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. In September 2014, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chile operations was subject to an effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chile operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019 and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chile legislature so that the 35 percent rate continues through 2021 increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter. In January 2020, the Chile legislature approved a tax reform package that would further delay the 44.5 percent rate until 2027 and thereafter. FCX does not expect a material impact from the 2020 legislation. In 2010, the Chile legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were 4 percent for the years 2013 through 2017. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023, rates moved to a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other (expense) income rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets was $231 million at December 31, 2019 , primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and other related mining taxes, and $186 million at December 31, 2018, and $22 million at December 31, 2017. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $376 million at December 31, 2019 , included $282 million ($150 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX ’ s tax treatment of social welfare payments and cost recovery methods. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with royalties and other related mining taxes and cost recovery methods. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities. In January 2020, PT-FI noted an unfavorable ruling related to its 2012 tax return on the Indonesia Supreme Court’s website. Once PT-FI receives the written ruling it will determine the amount of any required accruals, which are not expected to be material. If additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2020, FCX could experience an additional change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation, if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2019 , FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 24 U.S. states.

b. Adjustments to environmental obligations that do not provide future economic benefits are charged to operating income. Reductions primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects and other noncash adjustments.
============================================================

Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and unescalated basis) total $106 million in 2020 , $119 million in 2021 , $95 million in 2022 , $100 million in 2023 , $100 million in 2024 and $2.7 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2019 , FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.6 billion , including $1.4 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and unescalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.2 billion . FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion on an undiscounted and unescalated basis. At December 31, 2019 , the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2019 . FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping are expected to continue for many years in the future. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial options. The parties ’ RI/FS work under the AOC and their efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. EPA recently identified eight additional parties as PRPs for the creek. The draft RI was submitted to EPA in November 2016, and the draft FS is expected to be submitted to EPA in 2022. EPA is not expected to propose a final creek-wide remedy until after the RI/FS is completed, with remedial design possibly beginning in 2022, and the actual remediation construction starting several years later. In July 2019, NCG entered into an AOC to conduct a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the first two miles of the creek to support an evaluation of an interim remedy for that section of the creek (Early Action). The FFS was submitted to EPA in December 2019, and a decision on this Early Action is expected in late 2020. The actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the Early Action, the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. As a result of revised cost estimates, FCX recorded charges of $138 million during 2017 for the Newtown Creek environmental obligation. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. On January 30, 2017, a class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending. In December 2017, the plaintiffs amended their complaint and FCX was dismissed as a defendant and FMC was added as a defendant to the lawsuit. In 2019, the court allowed the plaintiffs to add FCX back into the case as a defendant. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants on-site and off-site through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for economic losses, including diminished property values, additional soil investigation and remediation and other damages. In January 2020, the parties completed briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class, which is expected to take at least several months for the court to decide. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX increased its associated environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation by recording a $59 million charge to operating income in 2017. Additional sampling and analysis continued through 2019 and is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. In 2019, FCX established a new project for off-site sediment contamination. The extent of contamination and potential remedial actions are uncertain and may take several years to evaluate. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In early 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. The settlement terms are contained in a Consent Decree executed on May 22, 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Under the Consent Decree, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. Based on updated cash flow and timing estimates, FCX reduced its associated obligation by recording a $41 million credit to operating income in 2017 after receiving court approval of the Consent Decree. In addition to uranium activities on tribal lands, FCX is conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on over 10,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. BLM may request additional assessment or reclamation activities for other claims with mining features. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Balance at beginning of year $2,547 $2,583 $2,638 Liabilities incurred Settlements and revisions to cash flow estimates, net (5) (112) Accretion expense Dispositions (5) (37) (10) Spending (170) (160) (71) Balance at end of year 2,505 2,547 2,583 Less current portion (330) (317) (286) Long-term portion $2,175 $2,230 $2,297
============================================================

ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2019 , FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.3 billion , of which $822 million was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had trust assets totaling $196 million (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $481 million . Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. A finalized closure plan for Chino that met the requirements of these rules was submitted in 2019 for approval. The agencies accepted the closure and post-closure scopes of work cost estimates, and FCX expects to reach an agreement with the agencies on financial assurance calculations and remaining issues in early 2020. Following agency approval of Chino’s closure plan and costs, updated closure plans for Tyrone and Cobre will also be submitted for approval, which FCX expects will result in increases in closure costs for its New Mexico operations. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $454 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona properties are subject to regulatory oversight in several areas. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards at an applicable point of compliance well or location during both operations and closure. The APP program also may require mitigation and discharge reduction or elimination of some discharges. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the cost to implement the closure strategy. An APP application specifies closure obligations, including post-closure monitoring and maintenance. A more detailed closure plan must be submitted within 90 days after a permitted entity notifies ADEQ of its intent to cease operations. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. In 2014, the state enacted legislation requiring closure costs for facilities covered by APPs to be updated no more frequently than every six years and financial assurance mechanisms to be updated no more frequently than every two years. In 2016, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Sierrita, which resulted in increased closure costs. In 2019, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Morenci (specific to the tailing dams), which resulted in increased closure costs. Morenci’s APP requires it to also update stockpile reclamation plans by 2022, which will result in increased closure costs. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Bagdad by 2024. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $345 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. During 2016, at the request of the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining & Safety, the Climax mine submitted a revised cost estimate for its current reclamation plan, which did not materially change the closure plan cost. In 2017, Henderson began considering alternatives for the closure of the tailings facility and, in 2018, began evaluating potential options for long-term water treatment. In December 2019, Henderson submitted an updated closure plan, which resulted in increased closure costs. As of December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $130 million for its Colorado operations. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. In July 2011, the Chile senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which established new requirements for closure plans. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, FCX’s El Abra operation submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval is expected in 2020. This update will not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $62 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the five-year closure plan and cost update required by the Mine Closure Law, the latest closure plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion were submitted to the Peru regulatory authorities in 2017 and approved in February 2018. This update did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $125 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. At December 31, 2019 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $936 million for its PT-FI operations. During fourth-quarter 2019 , PT-FI mined the final phase of the Grasberg open pit. As a result, any adjustments to the estimated costs to reclaim PT-FI’s overburden stockpile will impact earnings. In December 2009, PT-FI submitted its revised mine closure plan to the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources for review and addressed comments received during the course of this review process. In December 2010, the Indonesia government issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of the IUPK, submitted a revised mine closure plan to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At December 31, 2019 , PT-FI had $92 million in a restricted time deposit account for mine closure guarantees and $8 million for reclamation guarantees. In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) notified PT-FI of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the MOEF indicated are not reflected in PT-FI’s environmental permit. The MOEF also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, and tailings management. In December 2018, the MOEF issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. The remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and, in a few situations, PT-FI has agreed with the MOEF on an appropriate multi-year work plan, including the closure of an overburden stockpile. In addition, PT-FI continues to work with MOEF to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands. In December 2018, PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large-scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The MOEF issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by PT-FI that would target continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant long-term costs to PT-FI’s operations. The new framework enables PT-FI to maintain compliance with site-specific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the MOEF. In 2018, PT-FI recorded a $32 million charge for MOEF assessments of prior period permit fees. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) as of December 31, 2019 . FM O&G AROs cover approximately 210 wells and 120 platforms and other structures. At December 31, 2019 , FM O&G had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $420 million . Litigation. FCX is involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business or are associated with environmental issues as discussed in this note under “Environmental.” FCX is also involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Louisiana Parishes Coastal Erosion Cases. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants, along with numerous co-defendants, in 13 cases out of a total of 42 cases filed in Louisiana state courts by six south Louisiana parishes (Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist and Vermilion), alleging that certain oil and gas exploration and production operations and sulphur mining and production operations in coastal Louisiana contaminated and damaged coastal wetlands and caused significant land loss along the Louisiana coast. The state of Louisiana, through the Attorney General and separately through the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, intervened in the litigation in support of the parishes’ claims. Specifically, the cases alleged the defendants failed to obtain and/or comply with required coastal use permits in violation of the Louisiana State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, and sought unspecified damages for the alleged statutory violations, and restoration of the properties at issue to their original condition. Certain FCX affiliates were named as defendants in two of the five cases that had been set for trial, both originally filed on November 8, 2013: Parish of Plaquemines v. ConocoPhillips Company et al , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-982, Div. B and Parish of Plaquemines v. Hilcorp Energy Company et al , 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; No. 60-999, Div. B. In September 2019, affiliates of FCX reached an agreement in principle to settle all 13 cases. The maximum out-of-pocket settlement payment will be $23.5 million with the initial payment of $15 million to be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. The initial payment will be held in trust and later deposited into a newly formed Coastal Zone Recovery Fund (the Fund) once the state of Louisiana passes enabling legislation to establish the Fund. The settlement agreement will also require the FCX affiliates to pay into the Fund twenty annual installments of $4.25 million beginning in 2023 provided the state of Louisiana passes the enabling legislation. The first two of those annual installments are conditioned only on the enactment of the enabling legislation within three years of execution of the settlement agreement, but all subsequent installments are also conditioned on the FCX affiliates receiving simultaneous reimbursement on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the proceeds of environmental credit sales generated by the Fund, resulting in the $23.5 million maximum total payment obligation. The settlement agreement will need to be executed by all parties, including authorized representatives of the six south Louisiana parishes originally plaintiffs in the suit and certain other non-plaintiff Louisiana parishes and the state of Louisiana. Upon execution of the settlement agreement, the FCX affiliates will be fully released and dismissed from all 13 pending cases. The agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability by FCX or its affiliates. FCX recorded a charge in third-quarter 2019 for the initial payment of $15 million , which will be paid upon execution of the settlement agreement. FCX currently expects the settlement agreement to be executed during the first half of 2020. Asbestos and Talc Claims . Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (i) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (ii) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which has historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations, and has taken responsibility for all cases tendered to it. However, on February 13, 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys is no longer defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In addition, Imerys has taken the position that it alone owns, and has the sole right to access, the proceeds of the legacy insurance coverage of Cyprus Mines and CAMC for talc liabilities. In late March 2019, Cyprus Mines and CAMC challenged this position and obtained emergency relief from the bankruptcy court to gain access to the insurance until the question of ownership and contractual access can be decided in an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court, which is currently scheduled for March 2020. During first-quarter 2019, in a case pending at the time Imerys filed bankruptcy, a California jury entered a $29 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson and Cyprus Mines, of which approximately $2 million was attributed to Cyprus Mines. Taking advantage of the temporary access to the insurance authorized by the bankruptcy court, Cyprus Mines used the insurance to fully resolve the case. Cyprus Mines and the insurers also settled several other cases that were set for trial through the end of 2019 and in the first half 2020, and secured delays or dismissals in other cases. Multiple trials have been scheduled over the first half of 2020, and others may be scheduled prior to the adversary proceeding regarding the legacy insurance. FCX believes that Cyprus Mines and CAMC each has strong defenses to legal liability and that both should have access to the legacy insurance to cover defense costs, settlement and judgments, at least until the bankruptcy court decides otherwise or the insurance is exhausted. At this time, FCX cannot estimate the range of possible loss associated with these proceedings, but it does not currently believe the amount of any such losses are material to its consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX pays a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2013. Cerro Verde has contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. No assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15 -year stability agreement. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for the period from December 2006 through December 2013 under installment payment programs provided under Peru law. Through December 31, 2019, Cerro Verde has paid $354 million under these installment payment programs. In October 2017, the Peru Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were proper under Peru law. As a result of the unfavorable Peru Supreme Court ruling, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $186 million in 2017 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $348 million and $7 million of net tax charges, net of $169 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for royalty assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2013, penalties and interest related to assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2008, and other related items that Cerro Verde would have incurred under the view that its concentrator was not stabilized. In September 2018, the Peru Tax Tribunal denied Cerro Verde’s request to waive penalties and interest for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In December 2018, Cerro Verde elected not to appeal the Peru Tax Tribunal’s decisions. As a result, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $211 million in 2018 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $420 million , net of $18 million of tax benefits and $191 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for penalties and interest related to assessments for the years 2009 through 2013 and other related items. In November 2019, Cerro Verde filed a notice of intent to initiate international arbitration, which triggered a period for mandatory good faith settlement discussions. Cerro Verde also recognized a net gain of $16 million (consisting of pre-tax gains of $14 million and net tax benefits of $17 million , net of $15 million in noncontrolling interests) in 2018 for refunds received for the overpayment of special (voluntary) levies (GEM) for the period October 2012 through the year 2013. Cerro Verde has also submitted a refund request for the remainder of the GEM assessments for the period October 2011 through September 2012 totaling $57 million , but will not record a receivable for this amount until the request is granted by SUNAT. During 2019, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $7 million (consisting of pre-tax charges of $16 million , net of $2 million of tax benefits and $7 million of noncontrolling interests) associated with disputed royalties for prior years. A summary of the charges recorded for the years ended December 31 related to the Cerro Verde royalty dispute follows:

============================================================

As of December 31, 2019, Cerro Verde has recorded all of its exposure associated with its royalty dispute with the Peru tax authorities and will continue to record interest charges until all obligations are settled. Any future recoveries would be recorded when collected. Other Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

As of December 31, 2019 , Cerro Verde had paid $397 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $210 million , resulting in a net receivable of $187 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesia tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water and withholding tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesia government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================

As of December 31, 2019 , PT-FI had paid $178 million (included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which it believes is collectible. Surface Water Taxes . PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. As a result, PT-FI offered to pay one trillion rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged $69 million to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In May 2019, PT-FI agreed to a final settlement of 1.394 trillion rupiah (approximately $99 million) and recorded an incremental charge of $28 million . PT-FI paid 708.5 billion rupiah ($50 million) in October 2019, and will pay the balance of 685.5 billion rupiah ($50 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2019, and included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019) in February 2021. Export Duty Matter . In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesia government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former COW would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement. In the 2017 MOU, PT-FI agreed to continue to pay export duties of 5 percent on the value of copper concentrate export sales until completion of the divestment and new IUPK. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5 percent export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations, which PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018. PT-FI paid $155 million for this period, and appealed the disputed amounts to the Indonesia Tax Court. The Indonesia Tax Court subsequently announced rulings in favor of PT-FI related to the individual cases involving $29 million of the disputed amounts, which were refunded by the Indonesia Customs Office to PT-FI. The Indonesia Customs Office appealed the Indonesia Tax Court decisions on these cases to the Indonesia Supreme Court. On October 29, 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website rulings unfavorable to PT-FI for certain of the appealed cases involving approximately half of the $29 million that had been refunded to PT-FI. As a result of the October 2019 ruling, FCX recorded a charge of $155 million during third-quarter 2019 to fully reserve for this matter. PT-FI continues to believe that a five percent export duty was applicable during this period and is evaluating options to recover these overpayments. Withholding Tax Assessments . In January 2019, the Indonesia Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesia Supreme Court decision in November 2017 and has other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total approximately $46 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2019 , and included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019), including penalties and interest. As a result of the January 2019 ruling, PT-FI concluded a loss on all outstanding withholding tax matters is probable under applicable accounting guidance, and it recorded a charge of $61 million in 2018. For information regarding PT-FI mine development cost tax matters, refer to Note 11 . Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $665 million at December 31, 2019 , primarily for environmental and asset retirement obligations, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $344 million at December 31, 2019 , primarily associated with environmental and asset retirement obligations. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2019 , FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $52 million , which consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $41 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $11 million (a current portion of $2 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $9 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Leases. Effective January 1, 2019, FCX adopted the new ASU for lease accounting (refer to Note 1 for further discussion). FCX leases various types of properties, including offices and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Nearly all of FCX’s leases were considered operating leases under the new ASU. The components of FCX’s leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 , follow:

============================================================

Operating lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 , primarily included in production and delivery expense in the consolidated statement of operations, are as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

Prior to the adoption of the new ASU, lease costs totaled $80 million in 2018 and $59 million in 2017 (FCX elected the practical expedient not to adjust these years). FCX paid $43 million during 2019 for lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet (primarily included in operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows). As of December 31, 2019 , the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities was 5.5 percent and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 8.2 years . The future minimum payments for leases presented in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 , follow:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

Future minimum rentals under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2018, under the prior lease accounting standard, totaled $53 million in 2019, $42 million in 2020, $38 million in 2021, $32 million in 2022, $29 million in 2023 and $171 million thereafter. Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2019 , based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations (including take-or-pay contracts with terms less than one year) of $3.6 billion , primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($2.3 billion), cobalt ($470 million), electricity ($382 million) and transportation services ($268 million). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $1.6 billion in 2020 , $731 million in 2021 , $300 million in 2022 , $274 million in 2023 , $270 million in 2024 and $387 million thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 , FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. Special Mining License (IUPK) - Indonesia. As discussed in Note 2, on December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $106 million in 2019, $238 million in 2018 and $173 million in 2017. The IUPK requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent , declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter progress exceeds 50 percent . PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties for the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled $66 million in 2019 (excluding $155 million associated with the historical export duty matter as discussed in Note 12), $180 million in 2018 and $115 million in 2017. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019, which are recognized in production and delivery costs as incurred. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesia government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond at that time to support its commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia ($157 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2019). On September 12, 2019, PT-FI received approval from the Indonesia government to increase its export quota from approximately 180,000 dry metric tons (DMT) of concentrate to approximately 680,000 DMT for the current export period, which expires March 8, 2020. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. PT-FI had committed through December 31, 2019, to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the Partnership Fund. Negotiations to extend this agreement are currently underway though PT-FI will continue its contributions to ensure there are no interruptions in the implementation of approved projects. PT-FI charged $28 million in 2019 , $55 million in 2018 and $44 million in 2017 to cost of sales for this commitment. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , FCX had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production. A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the three years ended December 31, 2019 , resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2019 , FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 54 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.69 per pound, with maturities through August 2021 . A summary of gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized (losses) gains on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows:

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the LBMA gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and LBMA gold prices as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price and the LBMA gold price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2019 , follows:

============================================================

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in cost of sales. At December 31, 2019 , Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for 30 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.75 per pound, with maturities through February 2020 . Summary of Gains (Losses). A summary of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized in operating income for commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedge transactions, including embedded derivatives, for the years ended December 31 follows:

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances. A summary of these unsettled commodity contracts that are offset in the balance sheet follows:

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of December 31, 2019 , the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $74 million . Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019 , and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2018), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2019 , FCX has contingent consideration assets related to the sales of certain oil and gas properties (refer to Note 15 for the related fair values). Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the components presented in the consolidated balance sheets:

NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2019 . FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional cobalt purchases are valued using quoted monthly LME cobalt forward prices or average published Metals Bulletin cobalt prices, subject to certain adjustments as specified by the terms of the contracts, at each reporting date based on the month of maturity. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME copper prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME copper forward prices. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its onshore California oil and gas properties, which included contingent consideration of up to $150 million , consisting of $50 million per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over $70 per barrel in each of these calendar years. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was $11 million at December 31, 2019, and $16 million at December 31, 2018. Future changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in operating income. Also, contingent consideration of $50 million (included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018) was realized in 2018 and collected in first-quarter 2019 (included in proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties in the consolidated statements of cash flows) because the average Brent crude oil price exceeded $70 per barrel for 2018. Contingent consideration of $50 million was not realized in 2019 because the average Brent crude oil price did not exceeded $70 per barrel for 2019. The fair values, including the contingent consideration derivative associated with the 2016 TFHL sale (refer to Note 2 for further discussion), are calculated based on average commodity price forecasts through applicable maturity dates using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The models use various observable inputs, including Brent crude oil forward prices, historical copper and cobalt prices, volatilities, discount rates and settlement terms. As a result, these contingent consideration assets are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In 2016, FCX completed the sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, which included up to $150 million in contingent consideration that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The contingent consideration will be received over time as future cash flows are realized in connection with a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform. The first collection occurred in 2018. The balance included in (i) other current assets totaled $18 million at December 31, 2019, and $27 million at December 31, 2018, and (ii) other assets totaled $104 million at December 31, 2019, and $116 million at December 31, 2018. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2019 . A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 13 percent of FCX’s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 , and 12 percent for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2019 . Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $1.0 billion in 2019 , $1.2 billion in 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017 , and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $1.9 billion in 2019 , $2.2 billion in 2018 and $2.0 billion in 2017 . Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 37 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 21 percent was covered by agreements that expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire within one year. PT-FI and union officials have commenced discussions for a new two-year labor agreement. The existing agreement, which expired in September 2019, will continue in effect until a new agreement is consummated. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Bagdad, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Beginning in 2019, Bagdad became a reportable segment. As a result, FCX revised its segment disclosure for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, to conform with the current year presentation. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other segments, including Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining, and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting, until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced 50 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2019 . The Bagdad open-pit mine, located in west-central Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Bagdad mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Bagdad mine produced 15 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2019 . South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro Verde mine produced 85 percent of FCX’s South America copper during 2019 . Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper products facility, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2019 , Atlantic Copper purchased 22 percent of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 2 percent from FCX’s South America mining operations and 3 percent from FCX’s Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items. Other mining includes the Miami smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), Freeport Cobalt, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) and other mining support entities.

NOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been estimated as of December 31, 2019 , in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2019 , were determined using metals price assumptions of $2.50 per pound for copper, $1,200 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 , LME copper settlement prices averaged $2.83 per pound, LBMA gold prices averaged $1,306 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $10.50 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

============================================================

============================================================
• Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
============================================================

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 111 FREEPORT-McMoRan INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 percent -owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. During 2016, FCX completed sales of its Africa mining operation held by FMC and substantially all of its oil and gas operations. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion. FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in companies owned less than 20 percent , and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded using the cost method. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains (losses) totaled $14 million in 2018 , $(5) million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016 . Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia; guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations, and customs duty taxes; and funds held as cash collateral for surety bonds related to plugging and abandonment obligations of certain oil and gas properties. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of time deposits and money market funds. Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). 112 Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, including, depending on the process, mining, haulage, milling, concentrating, smelting, leaching, solution extraction, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. 113 Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and three to 30 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Oil and Gas Properties. FCX follows the full cost method of accounting specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules whereby all costs associated with oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized into a cost center on a country-by-country basis. Such costs include internal general and administrative costs, such as payroll and related benefits and costs directly attributable to employees engaged in acquisition, exploration and development activities. General and administrative costs associated with production, operations, marketing and general corporate activities are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalized costs, along with estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and asset retirement costs that are not already included in oil and gas properties, net of related salvage value, are amortized to expense under the UOP method using engineers’ estimates of the related, by-country proved oil and natural gas reserves. 114 The costs of unproved oil and gas properties were excluded from amortization until the properties were evaluated. Costs were transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties were evaluated and proved oil and natural gas reserves were established or if impairment was determined. Unproved oil and gas properties were assessed periodically, at least annually, to determine whether impairment had occurred. FCX assessed unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties were individually insignificant. The assessment considered the following factors, among others: intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results and activity, the assignment of proved reserves, the economic viability of development if proved reserves were assigned and other current market conditions. During any period in which these factors indicated an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs were transferred to the full cost pool and were then subject to amortization. Including amounts determined to be impaired, FCX transferred $4.9 billion of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool in 2016. The transfer of costs into the amortization base involved a significant amount of judgment. Costs not subject to amortization consisted primarily of capitalized costs incurred for undeveloped acreage and wells in progress pending determination, together with capitalized interest for these projects. Following the completion of the sales of oil and gas properties discussed in Note 2, FCX had no unproved oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 or 2017. Interest costs totaling $7 million in 2016 were capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development. Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless the reduction causes a significant change in proved reserves, which, absent other factors, is generally described as a 25 percent or greater change, and significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves attributable to a cost center, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Under the SEC full cost accounting rules, FCX reviewed the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the full cost pool for impairment each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, and related deferred income taxes) for each cost center may not exceed a “ceiling” equal to:

============================================================

============================================================
• the present value, discounted at 10 percent , of estimated future net cash flows from the related proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of estimated future income taxes; plus

============================================================

============================================================
• the lower of cost or estimated fair value of the related unproved properties included in the costs being amortized (net of related tax effects).
============================================================

These rules require that FCX price its future oil and gas production at the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. FCX’s reference prices are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for oil and the Henry Hub price for natural gas. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. The reserve estimates exclude the effect of any crude oil and natural gas derivatives FCX has in place. The estimated future net cash flows also exclude future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of the oil and gas properties. The rules require an impairment if the capitalized costs exceed this “ceiling.” In 2016, net capitalized costs with respect to FCX’s proved oil and gas properties exceeded the related ceiling test limitation; therefore, impairment charges of $4.3 billion were recorded primarily because of the lower twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference oil price and reserve revisions. Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of a mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. 115 Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to outside law firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. 116 Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, FCX adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which did not result in any financial statement impacts or changes to FCX’s revenue recognition policies or processes as revenue is primarily derived from arrangements in which the transfer of control coincides with the fulfillment of performance obligations. FCX recognizes revenue for all of its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional payment is made upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold settlement prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average LBMA gold settlement price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), cash-settled RSUs and cash-settled PSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model for SARs and FCX’s stock price for cash-settled RSUs and cash-settled PSUs. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards and SARs that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs and cash-settled PSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income (loss) per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive. 117 Reconciliations of net income (loss) and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

============================================================

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock. Stock options for 37 million shares of common stock were excluded in 2018 , 41 million in 2017 and 46 million in 2016 . New Accounting Standards. Following is a discussion of new accounting standards. Revenue Recognition. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to revenue recognition. FCX adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts that remain in force at the adoption date. The adoption of this standard did not result in any financial statement impacts or changes to FCX’s revenue recognition policies or processes as revenue is primarily derived from arrangements in which the transfer of control coincides with the fulfillment of performance obligations (refer to Revenue Recognition policy in this note). In connection with the adoption of the standard and consistent with FCX’s policy prior to adoption of the standard, FCX has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after control of goods has been transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost recorded in production and delivery costs on the consolidated statements of operations. 118 Financial Instruments. In January 2016, FASB issued an ASU that amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU makes limited changes to prior guidance and amends certain disclosure requirements. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adoption did not have a material impact on its financial statements. In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model, which requires consideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. For public companies, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. FCX is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that will require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019, and elected the practical expedient allowing it to apply the provisions of the updated lease guidance at the January 1, 2019, effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented. FCX also elected an accounting policy to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and a purchase option that is not expected to be exercised. FCX completed an assessment of its lease portfolio, implemented a new information technology system, and designed processes and controls to account for its leases in accordance with the new standard. FCX has concluded that the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its financial statements. FCX will begin making the required lease disclosures under the ASU beginning with its March 31, 2019, quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, FASB issued an ASU that changes the classification and presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU requires that a statement of cash flows include the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adjusted its consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents. The impact of adopting this ASU for the years ended December 31 follows:

Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Cost. In March 2017, FASB issued an ASU that changes how entities with defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans present net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. This ASU requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item or items as other compensation costs for those employees who are receiving the benefit. In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization when applicable (i.e. , as a cost of inventory or an internally constructed asset). The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside of operating income. These other components of net periodic benefit cost are not eligible for capitalization, and FCX elected to include these other components in other income (expense), net. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adjusted its presentation in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, to conform with the new guidance. The impact of adopting this ASU for the years ended December 31 follows:

120 Tax Reform Reclassification. In February 2018, FASB issued an ASU that allows entities to elect to reclassify the stranded income tax effects caused by the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings. This election applies to the U.S. federal income tax rate change from 35 percent to 21 percent. FCX elected to early adopt this standard effective July 1, 2018, which resulted in a one-time reclassification totaling $79 million from AOCI to retained earnings in third-quarter 2018. FCX has not elected to reclassify other “indirect” income tax effects of the Act stranded in AOCI. Any additional income tax effects stranded in AOCI will continue to pass through earnings in future periods as specific classes of AOCI items are reversed. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, FASB issued an ASU in connection with the disclosure framework project that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. FCX early adopted this ASU in third-quarter 2018, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements. Defined Benefit Plans . In August 2018, FASB issued an ASU in connection with the disclosure framework project that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. FCX early adopted this ASU in fourth-quarter 2018, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements. Reclassifications. As a result of adopting new accounting standards in 2018 (refer to New Accounting Standards in this Note) and the reclassification of assets held for sale (refer to Note 2), certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Pursuant to the previously announced divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), an Indonesian state-owned enterprise, acquired for cash consideration of $3.85 billion all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 percent of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which at the time owned 9.36 percent of PT-FI. Of the $3.85 billion in cash consideration, Rio Tinto received $3.5 billion , and FCX received $350 million . In addition, Rio Tinto paid FCX $107 million for its share of the 2018 joint venture cash flows. In connection with the transaction, an aggregate 40 percent share ownership in PT-FI was issued to PT Inalum and PTI (which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua). Based on a subscription of PT Inalum’s rights to acquire for cash consideration of $3.5 billion all of Rio Tinto’s interests in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of the entity (PT Rio Tinto Indonesia) that held Rio Tinto’s interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (26.24 percent) and PTI’s (25.00 percent) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 percent and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 percent . The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent from 2019 through 2022. The divestment agreement provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. 121 FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost-sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. FCX also analyzed PT-FI’s acquisition of the Rio Tinto Joint Venture interests and concluded the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in mineral reserves and related long-lived mining assets. The acquisition was a single asset because substantially all of the acquired assets are linked to each other and cannot be physically removed without causing a significant diminution to the fair value of the other assets. PT-FI allocated the $3.5 billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair value estimates were based on, but not limited to, long-term metal price assumptions of $3.00 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold; expected future cash flows based on estimated reserve quantities; costs to produce and develop the related reserves; current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets; and appropriate discount rates using an estimated international cost of capital of 14 percent. The estimates were primarily based on significant inputs not observable in the market (as discussed above) and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:

Under applicable accounting guidance, changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions with no impact on net income. The following table summarizes the consolidated impact of the transaction discussed above on FCX’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 21, 2018:

122 FCX considered if the adjustment to capital in excess of par value was an indicator of impairment and after considering other factors, such as PT-FI’s historical results and projected undiscounted cash flows, concluded that it did not indicate a potential impairment at PT-FI. TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. On November 16, 2016 , FCX completed the sale of its 70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound, both during the 24-month period beginning January 1, 2018. One-half of the proceeds from this transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan. The contingent consideration is considered a derivative, and the fair value will be adjusted through December 31, 2019. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was $57 million at December 31, 2018 , and $74 million at December 31, 2017. (Losses) gains resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative ($(17) million in 2018, $61 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2016) are included in net (loss) income from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt and copper prices. Future changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in discontinued operations. In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results of operations of TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations. Net (loss) income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:

Assets Held for Sale. As a result of the 2016 sale of TFHL, FCX planned to sell its effective 56 percent interest in Freeport Cobalt and its wholly owned Kisanfu exploration project. Freeport Cobalt includes the large-scale cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related sales and marketing business. Kisanfu is a copper and cobalt exploration project, located near Tenke in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The assets and liabilities of Freeport Cobalt and Kisanfu were previously classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, and a $110 million estimated loss on disposal was recognized in 2016 when these assets were classified as held for sale (included in net gain on sales of assets in the consolidated statements of operations). FCX is continuing to assess opportunities for its Kisanfu copper and cobalt exploration project, including development of the project on its own or a sale of all or a minority stake in the project. In 2017, a gain of $13 million was recorded to adjust the Kisanfu assets to their carrying value when they were initially classified as held for sale. In second-quarter 2018, management concluded it no longer believes that it is probable an outright sale will occur in the near term and the related assets and liabilities should no longer be classified as held for sale. Because of this conclusion, revisions to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, included a $90 million increase to property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, net, with an offsetting reduction in current assets held for sale, and a $27 million increase to deferred income taxes, with an offsetting reduction in current liabilities held for sale. FCX continues to market the Freeport Cobalt assets, but concluded that they no longer qualified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, during 2018, FCX recorded a gain of $97 million to adjust the Freeport Cobalt assets to their carrying value when they were initially classified as held for sale. During fourth-quarter 2018, FCX also recorded $48 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense that was suspended while the assets were held for sale from December 2016 through September 2018. The carrying amounts of Freeport Cobalt’s major classes of assets and liabilities, which were reclassified from held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, follow:

124 Morenci. In May 2016, FCX sold a 13 percent undivided interest in its Morenci unincorporated joint venture to SMM Morenci, Inc. for $1.0 billion in cash. FCX recorded a $576 million gain on the transaction and used losses to offset cash taxes on the transaction. A portion of the proceeds from the transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan and revolving credit facility. The Morenci unincorporated joint venture was owned 85 percent by FCX and 15 percent by Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (Sumitomo). As a result of the transaction, the unincorporated joint venture is owned 72 percent by FCX, 15 percent by Sumitomo and 13 percent by SMM Morenci, Inc. (an affiliate of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co, Ltd.). Timok. In May 2016, FMC sold an interest in the Timok exploration project in Serbia to Global Reservoir Minerals Inc. (now known as Nevsun Resources, Ltd.) for consideration of $135 million in cash and contingent consideration of up to $107 million payable to FCX in stages upon achievement of defined development milestones. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of $133 million in 2016, and no amounts were recorded for contingent consideration under the loss recovery approach. A portion of the proceeds from the transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan. Oil and Gas Operations. In 2018, FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G) disposed of certain property interests that resulted in the recognition of a gain of $27 million , primarily associated with the abandonment obligations that were assumed by the acquirer. In 2017, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of $80 million (before closing adjustments). Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales resulted in the recognition of gains of $49 million in 2017 . In December 2016, FM O&G completed the sale of its onshore California oil and gas properties to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC (Sentinel) for cash consideration of $592 million (before closing adjustments from the July 1, 2016, effective date) and contingent consideration of up to $150 million , consisting of $50 million per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over $70 per barrel in each of these calendar years. The contingent consideration is considered a derivative, and the fair value will be adjusted through the year 2020. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was $16 million at December 31, 2018 , and $34 million at December 31, 2017 . The contingent consideration of $50 million for 2018 was realized because the average Brent crude oil price exceeded $70 per barrel for the year and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Future changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in operating income. Sentinel assumed abandonment obligations associated with the properties. In December 2016, FM O&G completed the sale of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil and gas properties to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for cash consideration of $2.0 billion (before closing adjustments from the August 1, 2016, effective date) and up to $150 million in contingent payments. The contingent payments were recorded under the loss recovery approach, whereby contingent gains are recorded up to the amount of any loss on the sale, and reduced the loss on the sale in 2016. The contingent payments were included in other current assets ($27 million) and other assets ($116 million) at December 31, 2018, and in other current assets ($24 million) and other assets ($126 million) at December 31, 2017, in the consolidated balance sheets. The contingent payments will be received over time ($7 million was collected in 2018) as Anadarko realizes future cash flows in connection with a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform. Anadarko assumed abandonment obligations associated with these properties. A portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used to repay FCX’s remaining outstanding borrowings under its unsecured bank term loan. Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales of the Deepwater GOM and onshore California oil and gas properties required gain (loss) recognition (net loss of $9 million in 2016, which was net of $150 million for contingent payments associated with the Deepwater GOM sale and $33 million for the fair value of contingent consideration from the onshore California sale) because of their significance to the full cost pool. In connection with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, FM O&G entered into an agreement to amend the terms of the Plains Offshore Operations Inc. Preferred Stock that was reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest on FCX’s financial statements. The amendment provided FM O&G the right to call these securities for $582 million . FM O&G exercised this option in December 2016 and recorded a $199 million gain on redemption to retained earnings. 125 In July 2016, FM O&G sold its Haynesville shale assets for cash consideration of $87 million , before closing adjustments. In June 2016, FM O&G sold certain oil and gas royalty interests to Black Stone Minerals, L.P. for cash consideration of $102 million , before closing adjustments. Under the full cost accounting rules, the proceeds from these transactions were recorded as a reduction of capitalized oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition in 2016 because the reserves were not significant to the full cost pool. NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and molybdenum, with mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2018 , FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FCX has a 72 percent interest (subsequent to the sale of a 13 percent undivided interest on May 31, 2016) in Morenci (refer to “Joint Ventures – Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100 percent of the other North America mines.

Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings outstanding and $13 million in letters of credit issued under FCX’s revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately $3.5 billion , of which approximately $1.5 billion could be used for additional letters of credit. In April 2018, FCX, PT-FI and FM O&G LLC entered into a new $3.5 billion , five -year, unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced FCX’s prior revolving credit facility (scheduled to mature on May 31, 2019). The new revolving credit facility is available until April 20, 2023, with $500 million available to PT-FI, and up to $1.5 billion available in letters of credit, and has a substantially similar structure and terms as the prior revolving credit facility. Interest on loans made under the new revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the new revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings. Cerro Verde Credit Facility. In March 2014, Cerro Verde entered into a five -year, $1.8 billion senior unsecured credit facility that is nonrecourse to FCX and the other shareholders of Cerro Verde. In June 2017, Cerro Verde’s credit facility was amended (balance outstanding at the time of amendment was $1.275 billion) to increase the commitment by $225 million to $1.5 billion , to modify the amortization schedule and to extend the maturity date to June 19, 2022. The amended credit facility amortizes in four installments, with $225 million due on December 31, 2020 (of which $5 million was prepaid during 2018 and $220 million was prepaid during 2017), $225 million due on June 30, 2021 (which was fully prepaid during 2018), $525 million due on December 31, 2021 (of which $20 million was prepaid during 2018), and the remaining balance due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. All other terms, including the interest rates, remain the same. Interest under the term loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s credit facility was 4.42 percent at December 31, 2018. 129 Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans. In December 2014, Cerro Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its shareholders for borrowings up to $800 million . In June 2017, Cerro Verde used the proceeds from its amended credit facility plus available cash to repay the balance of its outstanding shareholder loans. The remaining availability for borrowings under these agreements totals $200 million . Senior Notes issued by FCX. In December 2016, FCX completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation associated with FM O&G LLC senior notes. Holders representing 89 percent of the outstanding FM O&G LLC senior notes tendered their notes and received new FCX senior notes. Each series of newly issued FCX senior notes have an interest rate that is identical to the interest rate of the applicable series of FM O&G LLC senior notes. The newly issued FCX senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of FCX and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of FCX. A summary of the tenders follows:

============================================================

============================================================

The principal amounts were increased by $151 million to reflect the remaining unamortized acquisition-date fair market value adjustments associated with the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions. In addition, FCX paid $14 million in cash consideration for FM O&G LLC’s senior notes that were tendered, which reduced the book value of the new FCX senior notes. All of these senior notes, except the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 and the 6 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2023, were redeemed during 2017 and the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 were redeemed during 2018 (refer to Early Extinguishment and Exchanges of Debt in this note). The 6 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2023 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to February 15, 2020, and at a specified redemption price thereafter. As of December 31, 2018, the book value of these senior notes totaled $768 million , which reflects the remaining unamortized acquisition-date fair market value adjustments ($46 million) and the cash consideration ($6 million) that are being amortized over the term of these senior notes and recorded as a net reduction of interest expense. In November 2014, FCX sold $750 million of 2.30% Senior Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid in 2017), $600 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021, $850 million of 4.55% Senior Notes due 2024 and $800 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due 2034 for total net proceeds of $2.97 billion . In March 2013, in connection with the financing of the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions, FCX issued $6.5 billion of unsecured senior notes in four tranches. FCX sold $1.5 billion of 2.375% Senior Notes due March 2018 (which matured and were repaid in 2018), $1.0 billion of 3.100% Senior Notes due March 2020, $2.0 billion of 3.875% Senior Notes due March 2023 and $2.0 billion of 5.450% Senior Notes due March 2043 for total net proceeds of $6.4 billion . In February 2012, FCX sold $500 million of 2.15% Senior Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid in 2017) and $2.0 billion of 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022 for total net proceeds of $2.47 billion . The 3.100% Senior Notes due 2020 and 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price. The senior notes listed below are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to the dates stated below, and beginning on the dates stated below at 100 percent of principal.

Partially offsetting the $54 million gain was $28 million in losses, primarily related to deferred debt issuance costs for an unsecured bank term loan that was repaid and costs associated with the December 2016 senior note exchange offer and consent solicitation. Guarantees. Refer to Note 17 for a discussion of FCX’s senior notes guaranteed by FM O&G LLC. 131 Restrictive Covenants. FCX’s revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants and representations, and also contains a number of negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of FCX’s subsidiaries that are not borrowers or guarantors to incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) and FCX’s or its subsidiaries’ abilities to: create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in mergers, liquidations and dissolutions; and sell assets. FCX’s revolving credit facility also contains financial ratios governing maximum total leverage and minimum interest expense coverage. FCX’s leverage ratio (ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement) cannot exceed 3.75 x, and the minimum interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement) is 2.25 x. FCX’s senior notes contain limitations on liens. At December 31, 2018 , FCX was in compliance with all of its covenants. Maturities. Maturities of debt instruments based on the principal amounts and terms outstanding at December 31, 2018 , total $17 million in 2019 , $1.0 billion in 2020 , $1.1 billion in 2021 , $2.4 billion in 2022 , $2.7 billion in 2023 and $3.9 billion thereafter.

Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes the periodic development of asset allocation studies and review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment committee considers these studies in the formal establishment of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s investment objective emphasizes diversification through both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various asset classes and the selection of investment managers whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager, is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset allocation approximates 41 percent equity investments (primarily global equities), 51 percent fixed income (primarily long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt securities) and 8 percent alternative investments (private real estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity). 132 The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 6.5 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2019. The 6.5 percent estimation was based on a passive return on a compound basis of 6.0 percent and a premium for active management of 0.5 percent reflecting the target asset allocation and current investment array. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments for service to date together with the Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which the participant completed 25 years of credited service. The annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesian rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesian national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesian pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 14,409 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2018 , and 13,480 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2017 . Indonesian labor laws require that companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits related to this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7.75 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2019. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Mercer Indonesian zero coupon bond yield curve derived from the Indonesian Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for those plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

============================================================

During 2018, the actuarial gain of $124 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 3.70 percent to 4.40 percent ($205 million), partially offset by new census data incorporated into the valuations ($33 million) and updated demographic assumptions ($49 million) mainly resulting from mortality updates. During 2017, the actuarial loss of $188 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 4.40 percent to 3.70 percent and the update to the actuarial basis for lump sum conversions. During 2018, the actuarial gain of $19 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 6.75 percent to 8.25 percent and demographic experience gains. During 2017, the actuarial gain of $61 million resulted primarily because of the workforce reduction during 2017, experience gains and a decline in the rate of compensation increase, partially offset by the decrease in the discount rate from 8.25 percent to 6.75 percent . 134 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s pension plans for the years ended December 31 follow:

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 135 A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. 136 Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) require up to a 60-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash. Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term.

Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Common stocks, government bonds and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 137 The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $13 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $115 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2018 , and a current portion of $14 million and a long-term portion of $129 million at December 31, 2017 . The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for these plans, which was determined on the same basis as FCX’s pension plans, was 4.20 percent at December 31, 2018 , and 3.50 percent at December 31, 2017 . Expected benefit payments for these plans total $13 million for 2019 , $13 million for 2020 , $13 million for 2021 , $12 million for 2022 , $11 million for 2023 and $47 million for 2024 through 2028 . The net periodic benefit cost charged to operations for FCX’s postretirement benefits (primarily for interest costs) totaled $5 million in 2018 , $5 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016 . The discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s postretirement benefits was 3.50 percent in 2018 , 3.80 percent in 2017 and 4.10 percent in 2016 . The medical-care trend rates assumed the first year trend rate was 7.75 percent at December 31, 2018 , which declines over the next 15 years with an ultimate trend rate of 4.25 percent . FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit consisted of a current portion of $6 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $39 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2018 , and a current portion of $5 million and a long-term portion of $38 million at December 31, 2017 . FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options. FCX contributes to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of employee pre-tax deferral contributions up to certain limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $45 million at December 31, 2018 , and $46 million at December 31, 2017 , all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans totaled $75 million in 2018 (none of which was capitalized), $65 million in 2017 (none of which was capitalized) and $78 million in 2016 (of which $4 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties). FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. Restructuring Charges. As a result of the first-quarter 2017 regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding long-term investment stability, PT-FI took actions to adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and slow investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. These actions included workforce reductions through furlough and voluntary retirement programs. Following the furlough and voluntary retirement programs, a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under the existing Indonesian 138 laws and regulations. As a result, PT-FI recorded charges in 2017 to production costs of $120 million , and selling, general and administrative costs of $5 million for employee severance and related costs, and a pension curtailment loss of $4 million in production costs. In early 2016, FCX restructured its oil and gas business to reduce costs and in late 2016, FCX sold substantially all of its remaining oil and gas properties. As a result, FCX recorded charges of $85 million to selling, general and administrative expenses and $6 million to production costs for net restructuring-related costs in 2016. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Common Stock. In November 2016, FCX completed a $1.5 billion registered at-the-market equity offering of common stock that was announced on July 27, 2016. FCX sold 116.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $12.87 per share, which generated gross proceeds of $1.5 billion (net proceeds of $1.48 billion after $15 million of commissions and expenses). During 2016, FCX issued 48.1 million shares of its common stock (with a value of $540 million , excluding $5 million of commissions paid by FCX) in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts. Also during 2016, FCX negotiated private exchange transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, whereby 27.7 million shares of FCX’s common stock were issued (with an aggregate value of $311 million), in exchange for $369 million principal amount of FCX’s senior notes. From January 1, 2016, through January 5, 2016, FCX sold 4.3 million shares of its common stock, which generated proceeds of $29 million (after $0.3 million of commissions and expenses). FCX used the proceeds to repay indebtedness. In February 2018, FCX’s Board of Directors (the Board) reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock with an annual rate of $0.20 per share. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board and will depend on FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

139 Stock Award Plans. FCX currently has awards outstanding under various stock-based compensation plans. The stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2018 , 58.6 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 Plan, and no shares were available under other plans. Stock-Based Compensation Cost.

a. Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Stock options granted prior to 2018 generally vest in 25 percent annual increments and beginning in 2018 awards granted vest in 33 percent annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. A summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2018 , and activity during the year ended December 31, 2018 , follows:

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the annual dividend (excluding supplemental dividends) at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. 140 Information related to stock options during the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Rounds to less than $1 million. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had $23 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years . Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers were granted PSUs that vest after three years. For the PSUs granted in 2017 and 2016, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive officers will be determined based on (i) FCX’s achievement of certain financial and operational performance metrics and (ii) FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the shareholder return of a peer group. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.6 million for 2017 and 1.5 million for 2016, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 175 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial and operating metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to a peer group. For the PSUs granted in 2018, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive officers will be determined based on (i) FCX’s achievement of certain financial metrics and (ii) FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the shareholder return of a peer group. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.5 million for 2018, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to a peer group. All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years to certain employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors. Beginning in December 2015, RSUs granted to directors vest on the first anniversary of the grant. Prior to December 2015, RSUs granted to directors generally vest over a period of four years. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

The total intrinsic value of stock-settled RSUs vested was $14 million during 2018 , $45 million during 2017 and $22 million during 2016 . As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had $6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.1 years . Cash-Settled RSUs and PSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control (as defined in the award agreements). In 2015, certain members of FM O&G’s senior management were granted cash-settled PSUs that vested over three years. The total grant date target shares related to the 2015 cash-settled PSU grants were 582 thousand shares, of which FM O&G’s senior management earned a total of 487 thousand shares at maturity during 2018 based on the achievement of applicable performance goals. The cash-settled RSUs and PSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.8 billion that will expire between 2019 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of $6.0 billion that expire between 2036 and 2037, (iii) U.S. state net operating losses of $10.5 billion that expire between 2019 and 2038, (iv) Spanish net operating losses of $537 million that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesian net operating losses of $975 million that expire between 2020 and 2025. 144 Valuation Allowance. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2018 , including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.5 billion at December 31, 2018 , and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2017 , and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state net operating losses. FCX’s valuation allowances at December 31, 2017 , also covered all of its U.S. federal capital losses. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 . FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and foreign deferred tax assets totaled $2.2 billion and $458 million , respectively, at December 31, 2018 . Net operating losses and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and provides a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or net operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented. The $68 million net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2018 primarily related to decreases totaling $315 million in U.S. foreign tax credits associated with expirations and 2017 tax reform adjustments, and $45 million in U.S. federal net operating losses associated with 2018 usage and 2017 tax reform adjustments, partly offset by a $244 million increase in foreign net operating losses for which no benefit is expected to be realized. 2017 U.S. Tax Reform. The Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, included significant modifications to then-existing U.S. tax laws and created many new complex tax provisions. The Act reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent , eliminated the corporate AMT, provided for a refund of AMT credits, maintained hard minerals percentage depletion, allowed for immediate expensing of certain qualified property and generally broadened the tax base. The Act also created a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), created anti-base erosion rules that require companies to pay a minimum tax on foreign earnings and may disallow certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties. In December 2018, FCX completed its analysis of the Act and recognized benefits totaling $123 million associated with AMT credit refunds. In 2017, FCX recorded net tax benefits related to specific provisions of the Act totaling $393 million , reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits through 2021 ($272 million) and a decrease in corporate income tax rates ($121 million). Elimination of Corporate AMT and Refund of AMT Credits. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate AMT was repealed. FCX has historically incurred an AMT liability in excess of regular tax liability, resulting in accumulated AMT credits totaling $490 million as of December 31, 2017. The Act allows the use of existing corporate AMT credits to offset regular tax liability for tax years after December 31, 2017. AMT credits in excess of regular liability are refundable on tax returns for the years 2018 through 2021. Prior to the Act, FCX recognized a $110 million benefit for AMT credits expected to be refunded. As a result of the Act, FCX recognized a provisional net benefit of $272 million in 2017, consisting of a $380 million tax benefit for historical AMT credits expected to be refunded, partially offset by a $108 million tax charge to establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. At December 31, 2018, FCX recognized an additional $123 million net benefit for historical AMT credits consisting of $51 million in additional refundable credits and $72 million in reduction to reserves. 145 Reduction in Corporate Income Tax Rate. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent . While applicable for years after December 31, 2017, existing income tax accounting guidance requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. In fourth-quarter 2017, FCX recognized this change in the federal statutory rate and recorded a provisional net benefit of $121 million , consisting of a $1.1 billion tax benefit associated with changes in related valuation allowances, partly offset by a $975 million tax charge related to existing net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities. In fourth-quarter 2018, FCX finalized the impact of this change in federal statutory rate resulting in a net zero impact, consisting of a $32 million tax benefit associated with changes in related valuation allowances offset by a $32 million tax charge related to existing net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Transition Tax on Previously Deferred Foreign Earnings. Under the Act, U.S. shareholders owning at least 10 percent of a foreign subsidiary generally must recognize taxable income equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated post-1986 historical Earnings and Profits (E&P). The portion of any E&P associated with cash or cash equivalents is taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent , while any remaining E&P is taxed at a reduced rate of 8 percent . The resulting tax liability (Transition Tax) may be reduced by available foreign tax credits. Because FCX operates in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates in excess of the U.S. historical statutory tax rate of 35 percent , the December 31, 2017, Transition Tax was fully offset by foreign tax credits generated in 2017. During fourth-quarter 2018, additional guidance was released by the IRS clarifying the computation of Transition Tax liability. As a result of this additional guidance, FCX recognized a $29 million tax charge related to Transition Tax for 2018. Anti-Base Erosion Rules. For tax years that begin after December 31, 2017, applicable taxpayers are required to pay the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). BEAT is an alternative tax calculation that disallows deduction of certain amounts paid or accrued by a U.S. taxpayer to a foreign related party. The BEAT provisions do not currently impact FCX’s computation of U.S. federal taxable income. The Act also included provisions to tax a new class of income called Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). Under the new GILTI provisions, FCX will use U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in current and future tax years against income that would otherwise not generate a net tax liability absent the availability of net operating losses. As a result, FCX does not consider GILTI to be a source of income against which a benefit for U.S. federal net operating losses can be realized. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, FCX is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (i) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (ii) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Executive Compensation Limitation. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, tax deductible compensation of covered employees is limited to $1 million . In addition, the definition of covered employees is revised to include the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, and the three other highest paid officers. If an individual is a covered employee for a tax year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all future years. Under a transition rule, the changes do not apply to any remuneration under specified contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. During fourth-quarter 2018, FCX determined that only immaterial adjustments were needed in relation to future disallowance of deferred executive compensation balances as of December 31, 2017. Other. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX has offset $5.4 billion of foreign source income with U.S. source losses. Under existing U.S. tax law, FCX has the ability to re-characterize $5.4 billion of future U.S. source income into foreign source income. While utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits is dependent upon FCX generating future U.S. tax liabilities within the carryforward period, this re-sourcing may permit FCX to utilize up to $1.1 billion of the $1.8 billion foreign tax credits that would otherwise expire unused. Other Events. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesian government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to a 25 percent corporate income tax rate and a 10 percent profits tax on net income beginning in 2019. As a result of the change in statutory tax rate applicable to deferred income tax liabilities, during fourth-quarter 2018, FCX recognized a tax credit of $504 million . 146 SUNAT, the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute and net charges recorded in 2018 and 2017. In December 2016, the Peruvian parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from 4.1 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent , and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent . Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. In September 2014, the Chilean legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chilean operations was subject to an effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chilean operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019 and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chilean legislature so that the 35 percent rate continues through 2021 increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter. In 2010, the Chilean legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were 4 percent for the years 2013 through 2017. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023, rates moved to a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income and expense rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets was $186 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and other related mining taxes, and $22 million at December 31, 2017, and $19 million at December 31, 2016. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $404 million at December 31, 2018 , included $296 million ($147 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX ’ s tax treatment of social welfare payments and cost recovery methods. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with royalties and other related mining taxes and AMT credit refunds. 147 Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the lapse of statute of limitations were primarily related to social welfare payments. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during 2019 , FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years for FCX’s major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are as follows:

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation, if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 26 U.S. states. A summary of changes in estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

148 Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and unescalated basis) total $132 million in 2019 , $117 million in 2020 , $119 million in 2021 , $88 million in 2022 , $100 million in 2023 and $2.7 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.5 billion , including $1.4 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and unescalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.3 billion . FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion on an undiscounted and unescalated basis. At December 31, 2018 , the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018 . FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping are expected to continue for many years in the future. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial options. The parties ’ RI/FS work under the AOC and their efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. EPA recently identified eight additional parties as PRPs for the creek. The draft RI was submitted to EPA in November 2016, and the draft FS is expected to be submitted to EPA by the end of 2020. EPA is not expected to propose a final remedy until after the RI/FS is completed, but has recently considered allowing for interim remedial measures as suggested by the PRPs. EPA’s remedial decision could be made in 2021 and remedial design could begin in 2022, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. The actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. During 2017, FCX recorded charges of $138 million for revised cost estimates for the Newtown Creek environmental obligation. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate onsite and offsite conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. 149 From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. On January 30, 2017, a class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending. In December 2017, the plaintiffs amended their complaint and FCX was dismissed as a defendant and FMC was added as a defendant to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants onsite and offsite through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified damages for economic losses, including loss of property value, medical monitoring, punitive damages and other damages. In October 2018, the magistrate judge denied the plaintiffs’ July 2018 request to amend the complaint to rejoin FCX as a defendant, and the plaintiffs have appealed that decision. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX increased its associated environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation by recording a $59 million charge to operating income in 2017. Additional sampling and analysis occurred through 2018 and is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1970s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In January 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. The settlement terms are outlined in a Consent Decree that was filed on January 17, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Under the Consent Decree, which the U.S. Government valued at over $600 million , the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. Based on updated cash flow and timing estimates, FCX reduced its associated obligation by recording a $41 million credit to operating income in 2017 after receiving court approval of the Consent Decree. In addition to uranium activities on tribal lands, FCX is conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on over 10,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM may provide no further action determinations for undisturbed claims or requests for additional assessment or reclamation activities for others. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

150 ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.2 billion , of which $703 million was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had trust assets totaling $180 million (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $545 million . Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC). In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. In 2013, the WQCC adopted Supplemental Permitting Requirements for Copper Mining Facilities, which became effective on December 1, 2013, and specify closure requirements for copper mine facilities. The rules were adopted after an extensive stakeholder process in which FCX participated and were jointly supported by FCX and NMED. The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the rules in 2018, following a challenge by certain environmental organizations and the New Mexico Attorney General. Finalized closure plans that meet the requirements of these rules will be submitted in 2019 and will result in material increases in closure costs for FCX’s New Mexico operations. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans describing the reclamation to be performed following cessation of mining operations. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $450 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona properties are subject to regulatory oversight in several areas. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards at an applicable point of compliance well or location during both operations and closure. The APP program also may require mitigation and discharge reduction or elimination of some discharges. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the cost to implement the closure strategy. An APP application specifies closure obligations, including post-closure monitoring and maintenance. A more detailed closure plan must be submitted within 90 days after a permitted entity notifies ADEQ of its intent to cease operations. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. In 151 2014, the state enacted legislation requiring closure costs for facilities covered by APPs to be updated no more frequently than every six years and financial assurance mechanisms to be updated no more frequently than every two years. In 2016, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Sierrita, which resulted in increased closure costs. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Morenci in April 2019. FCX expects to update the closure strategy and closure costs for Morenci’s stockpiles in 2020. FCX intends to update Bagdad closure costs in 2021. FCX has also proposed a closure strategy and closure costs for a former leach stockpile at Bisbee (a discontinued operation), which is currently under review by ADEQ. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. During 2017, Safford submitted an update to its reclamation plan to include the Lone Star expansion, which increased its reclamation costs. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $367 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. During 2016, at the request of the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining & Safety, the Climax mine submitted a revised cost estimate for its current reclamation plan, which did not materially change the closure plan cost. In 2017, Henderson began considering alternatives for the closure of the tailings facility and, in 2018, began evaluating potential options for long-term water treatment, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $61 million for its Colorado operations. In 2019, a bill has been introduced in the Colorado legislature that requires financial assurance for long-term water management and eliminates the potential for future permits for mining sites that include long-term water management as part of the closure strategy. The long-term water management component of the bill will apply to Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. Chilean Reclamation and Closure Programs. In July 2011, the Chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which established new requirements for closure plans. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, FCX’s El Abra operation submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval is expected in 2019. This update will not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $63 million for its El Abra operation. Peruvian Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the five year closure plan and cost update required by the Mine Closure Law, the latest closure plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion were submitted to the Peruvian regulatory authorities in 2017 and approved in February 2018. This update did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $105 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesian Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. At the end of 2016, PT-FI revised its estimates for an overburden stockpile to address ongoing erosion that occurred during 2016, a design change that increased the volume and updated cost estimates reflecting more recent productivity and costs at the overburden stockpile, which resulted in an increase in the ARO of $372 million . At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $991 million for its PT-FI operations. PT-FI is currently mining in the final phase of the Grasberg 152 open pit and expects to transition to the underground mine in the first half of 2019. As a result, beginning in 2019, any adjustments to the costs for the overburden stockpile will impact earnings. In December 2009, PT-FI submitted its revised mine closure plan to the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources for review and addressed comments received during the course of this review process. In December 2010, the Indonesian government issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of the IUPK, submitted a revised mine closure plan to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At December 31, 2018 , PT-FI funded $90 million into a restricted time deposit account for mine closure guarantees and $11 million for reclamation guarantees. In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) notified PT-FI of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the MOEF indicated are not reflected in its environmental permit. The MOEF also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, and tailings management. In December 2018, the MOEF issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. The remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and, in a few situations, PT-FI has agreed with the MOEF on an appropriate multi-year work plan, including the closure of an overburden stockpile. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large-scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The MOEF issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by PT-FI that would target continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant long-term costs to PT-FI’s operations. The new framework enables PT-FI to maintain compliance with site-specific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the MOEF. In 2018, PT-FI recorded a $32 million charge for assessments of prior period permit fees with the MOEF. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions in 2016, 2017 and 2018, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas include offshore California and onshore in South Louisiana as of December 31, 2018 . FM O&G AROs cover approximately 210 wells and 120 platforms and other structures. At December 31, 2018 , FM O&G had accrued $476 million associated with its AROs. Litigation. FCX is involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business or are associated with environmental issues as discussed in this note under “Environmental.” FCX is also involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. FM O&G LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, is a defendant in a purported class action titled David Garcia v. Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC filed on April 1, 2016, in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Barbara (Case No. 16CV01305) and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the District Court). The plaintiff, a former FM O&G LLC employee who worked on offshore production platforms in federal waters, alleged violations of various California wage and hour laws and sought relief for past wages, overtime, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees. The case was dismissed by the District Court on the basis that federal law, not state law, applied, and the complaint alleged no violations of federal law. The dismissal was appealed by the plaintiff to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the case is currently stayed in deference to the ongoing appeal of a similar case. Based on recent developments, FCX has concluded that its exposure in the Garcia case is not material to its consolidated financial statements. 153 Asbestos and Talc Claims. Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a recent significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. In these cases, plaintiffs allege serious health risks and often fatal diseases, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer, allegedly caused by long-term use of talc-based cosmetic and personal care products. Nationwide trial results in these cases have ranged from outright dismissals to large jury awards of both compensatory and punitive damages. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, is one of those targets. One of CAMC’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Cyprus Mines Corporation, was involved in talc mining until 1992 when it exited that business. CAMC has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against the ultimate successor to the business, which has acknowledged those indemnification obligations, and has taken responsibility for all cases tendered to it to date. However, on February 13, 2019, the indemnitor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and CAMC is in the very early stages of evaluating the potential implications of that filing. To date, no judgments have been rendered against CAMC, and FCX believes that CAMC has strong defenses. Accordingly, FCX currently believes the losses, if any, related to these cases, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2013. Cerro Verde has contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. No assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15 -year stability agreement. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for the period from December 2006 through December 2008 under an installment program ($188 million paid by Cerro Verde through December 31, 2018). Cerro Verde will also begin making monthly payments beginning in second-quarter 2019 under a 66-month payment plan related to assessments for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In October 2017, the Peruvian Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were proper under Peruvian law. As a result of the unfavorable Peruvian Supreme Court ruling, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $186 million in 2017 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $348 million and $7 million of net tax charges, net of $169 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for royalty assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2013, penalties and interest related to assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2008, and other related items that Cerro Verde would have incurred under the view that its concentrator was not stabilized. 154 In September 2018, the Peruvian Tax Tribunal denied Cerro Verde’s request to waive penalties and interest for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In December 2018, Cerro Verde elected not to appeal the Peruvian Tax Tribunal’s decisions and is continuing to evaluate alternative strategies to defend its rights, including international arbitration. As a result, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $211 million in 2018 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $420 million , net of $18 million of tax benefits and $191 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for penalties and interest related to assessments for the years 2009 through 2013 and other related items. Cerro Verde also recognized a net gain of $16 million (consisting of pre-tax gains of $14 million and net tax benefits of $17 million , net of $15 million in noncontrolling interests) in 2018 for refunds received for the overpayment of special (voluntary) levies (GEM) for the period October 2012 through the year 2013. Cerro Verde has also submitted a refund request for the remainder of the GEM assessments for the period October 2011 through September 2012 totaling $57 million , but will not record a receivable for this amount until the request is granted by SUNAT. As of December 31, 2018, Cerro Verde has recorded all of its exposure associated with its royalty dispute with the Peruvian tax authorities and will continue to record interest charges until all obligations are settled. Any future recoveries would be recorded when collected. A summary of the charges recorded in 2018 and 2017 for the Cerro Verde royalty dispute follows:

============================================================

Other Peruvian Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

As of December 31, 2018 , Cerro Verde had paid $386 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $203 million , resulting in a net receivable of $183 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. 155 Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water and withholding tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesian government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Interest Assessment Total $$$2007 2008, 2010 to 2011 2012 — 2013 2014 2015 — 2016 $1,016 $$1,304
============================================================

As of December 31, 2018 , PT-FI had paid $493 million (included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which it believes is collectible. PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. PT-FI has filed or will file appeals of these assessments with the Indonesia Tax Court. During the first half of 2018 and in fourth-quarter 2018, the Indonesia Tax Court ruled partially in favor of PT-FI with respect to assessments for the period January 2016 through April 2017 by reducing these assessments from $80 million , including penalties, to $48 million , including penalties (based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2018), or an approximate 40 percent reduction. During 2017, PT-FI filed reconsideration request petitions to the Indonesia Supreme Court with respect to assessments for the period from January 2011 through December 2015; and in second-quarter 2018, filed reconsideration request petitions with respect to the Indonesia Tax Court decisions related to the assessments for the period from January 2016 through April 2016. In second-quarter 2018, the Indonesia Supreme Court issued favorable decisions relating to surface water tax assessments for the period January 2011 through July 2015. The Indonesia Supreme Court ruling concluded that PT-FI and the Indonesian government are bound by PT-FI’s former COW, which is lex specialis, and prevails as the law for the parties to the former COW that should be carried out in good faith. As a result, FCX estimates the total amount of the assessments, including penalties, (based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2018) for the period from August 2015 through December 2018 totals $174 million , including $87 million in penalties. In accordance with its IUPK discussed in Note 13, PT-FI is obligated to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019. In addition, PT-FI has offered to pay one trillion rupiah ($69 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018) to settle historical disputes regarding surface water taxes, which was charged to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In September 2018, PT-FI received an unfavorable decision from the Indonesian Tax Court with respect to its appeal of disallowed items on its 2012 corporate income tax return. The most significant disallowed item relates to the tax treatment of mine development costs. A similar decision on PT-FI’s 2014 corporate income tax return was announced in October 2018. PT-FI has filed or will file appeals related to these decisions to the Indonesian Supreme Court because it believes the former COW is explicit about the tax treatment associated with mine development costs. No adjustments have been recorded for this matter as of December 31, 2018, because FCX believes PT-FI has properly determined and paid its taxes. As of December 31, 2018 , PT-FI had long-term receivables totaling approximately $350 million related to this matter, and no reserves have been recorded for these receivables. FCX estimates the potential exposure for penalties for the years 2013, 2016 and 2017, in which the Indonesian tax authorities may assert that PT-FI has underpaid income taxes, totals $251 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. 156 In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former COW would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement. In the 2017 MOU, PT-FI agreed to continue to pay a 5 percent export duty during this period. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5 percent export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations, which PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018. PT-FI is disputing the incremental 2.5 percent export duty while the matter is pending in Indonesia Tax Court proceedings, and amounts paid are being held in a restricted cash account or in a current or long-term receivable in the consolidated balance sheets ($144 million at December 31, 2018, consisting of $15 million in income and other tax receivables, $7 million in other current assets and $122 million in other assets; and $38 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of $22 million in other current assets and $16 million in other assets) that PT-FI expects to have released or refunded in full once the matter is resolved. In December 2018, the Indonesia Tax Court announced a ruling in favor of PT-FI related to $15 million of the disputed export duties, which PT-FI expects to collect in 2019. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to an export duty until smelter development reaches 50 percent , at which time the export duty will be eliminated (refer to Note 13 for export duty rates). In January 2019, PT-FI noted that the Indonesian Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesian Supreme Court decision in November 2017 and has other pending cases at the Indonesian Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total approximately $61 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), including penalties and interest. As a result of the January 2019 ruling, PT-FI concluded a loss on all outstanding withholding tax matters is probable under applicable accounting guidance, and it recorded a charge of $61 million in 2018. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $528 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily for environmental and asset retirement obligations, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $342 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily associated with environmental and asset retirement obligations. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $60 million , which consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $49 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $15 million (a current portion of $2 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $13 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. 157 NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Operating Leases. FCX leases various types of properties, including offices and equipment. Future minimum rentals under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2018 , total $53 million in 2019 , $42 million in 2020 , $38 million in 2021 , $32 million in 2022 , $29 million in 2023 and $171 million thereafter. Minimum payments under operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals, which are minimal. Total aggregate rental expense under operating leases was $80 million in 2018 , $59 million in 2017 and $71 million 2016 . Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2018 , based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations of $2.9 billion , primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($1.5 billion), cobalt ($0.5 billion), electricity ($0.4 billion) and transportation services ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $2.1 billion in 2019 , $234 million in 2020 , $147 million in 2021 , $50 million in 2022 , $44 million in 2023 and $301 million thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. Special Mining License (IUPK) - Indonesia. As discussed in Note 2, on December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesian government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesian government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesian government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $238 million in 2018, $173 million in 2017 and $131 million in 2016. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent , declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter progress exceeds 50 percent . PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties for the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled $180 million in 2018, $115 million in 2017 and $95 million in 2016. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesian government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond at that time to support its commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia ($126 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2018). PT-FI has applied for a one-year extension of its export license, which currently expires on February 16, 2019. 158 Other. In 2016, FCX negotiated the termination and settlement of FM O&G’s drilling rig contracts with Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (Noble) and Rowan Companies plc (Rowan). Under the settlement with Noble, FCX issued 48.1 million shares of its common stock (representing a value of $540 million) during second-quarter 2016, and Noble immediately sold these shares. Under the settlement with Rowan, FCX paid $215 million in cash during 2016. FCX also agreed to provide contingent payments of up to $75 million to Noble and up to $30 million to Rowan, depending on the average price of crude oil over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. In January 2017, FCX paid $6 million to early settle a portion of the Rowan contingent payments and no additional payments were due when the contingency period ended on June 30, 2017. As a result of the settlements, FM O&G was released from a total of $1.1 billion in payment obligations under its three drilling rig contracts. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. PT-FI has committed through June 30, 2019, to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the Partnership Fund. PT-FI charged $55 million in 2018 , $44 million in 2017 and $33 million in 2016 to cost of sales for this commitment. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. As a result of the acquisition of the oil and gas business in 2013, FCX assumed a variety of crude oil and natural gas commodity derivatives to hedge the exposure to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, all of which had matured by December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , FCX had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production. A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows. 159 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the three years ended December 31, 2018 , resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2018 , FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 68 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.77 per pound, with maturities through June 2020 . A summary of (losses) gains recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized gains (losses) on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows:

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the LMBA gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded to revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX prices, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2018 , follows:

============================================================

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Contracts. FCX had no outstanding crude oil or natural gas derivative contracts as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. As part of the terms of the agreement to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties, FM O&G entered into derivative contracts during October 2016. Sentinel assumed these contracts at the time of the sale in December 2016. These derivative contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and were recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues (oil contracts) and production costs (natural gas contracts). 160 Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in cost of sales. At December 31, 2018 , Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for 8 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.76 per pound, with maturities through February 2019 .

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances. 161 A summary of these unsettled commodity contracts that are offset in the balance sheet follows:

============================================================

============================================================

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of December 31, 2018 , the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $16 million . Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2018 , and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2018 , FCX has contingent consideration assets related to certain 2016 asset sales (refer to Note 15 for the related fair value and to Note 2 for further discussion of these instruments). Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

162 NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2018 . FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

164 Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional cobalt purchases are valued using quoted monthly LME cobalt forward prices or average published Metals Bulletin cobalt prices, subject to certain adjustments as specified by the terms of the contracts, at each reporting date based on the month of maturity. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. The fair value of contingent consideration for the sales of TFHL and onshore California oil and gas properties (refer to Note 2 for further discussion) is calculated based on average commodity price forecasts through applicable maturity dates using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The models use various observable inputs, including Brent crude oil forward prices, historical copper and cobalt prices, volatilities, discount rates and settlement terms. As a result, these contingent consideration assets are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of contingent consideration for the sale of Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (refer to Note 2 for further discussion) is calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2018 . 165 A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 12 percent of FCX’s consolidated revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2018 . Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $1.2 billion in 2018 , $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016 , and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $2.2 billion in 2018 , $2.0 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016 . Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 37 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 21 percent was covered by agreements that expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire within one year. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other divisions, including Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly owned smelter and refinery in Spain) and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned smelter and refinery in Indonesia), until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. 167 FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced 49 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2018 . South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro Verde mine produced 84 percent of FCX’s South America copper during 2018 . Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper products facility, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2018 , Atlantic Copper purchased 14 percent of its concentrate requirements from the North America copper mines, 5 percent from the South America mining operations and 4 percent from the Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining and eliminations, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items. Other mining and eliminations include the Miami smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), Freeport Cobalt, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) and other mining support entities. 168 Financial Information by Business Segment

NOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated as of December 31, 2018 , in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2018 , were determined using $2.50 per pound for copper in North America and South America and $2.00 per pound for copper in Indonesia, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. Reserves for Indonesia would not significantly change if assessed under a long-term price of $2.50 per pound of copper as PT-FI’s reserve plan is mill-constrained by the term of its IUPK, which contains rights to extend mining rights through 2041. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , LME copper settlement prices averaged $2.65 per pound, LBMA gold prices averaged $1,259 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $8.85 per pound. 178 The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

181 Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Information. The following information summarizes the net proved reserves of oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs)), and natural gas and the standardized measure as described below for the year ended December 31, 2016. All of FCX’s oil and natural gas reserves are located in the U.S. Management believes the reserve estimates presented herein are reasonable and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC as prescribed in Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. However, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond FCX’s control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because all oil and natural gas reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures, and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data. Therefore, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (Standardized Measure) shown below represents estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated reserves attributable to FCX’s oil and gas properties. In this regard, the information set forth in the following tables includes revisions of reserve estimates attributable to proved properties acquired in the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions, and reflects additional information from subsequent development activities, production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices. Estimated Quantities of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. The following table sets forth certain data pertaining to proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, all of which are in the U.S., for the year ended December 31, 2016 .

The average realized sales prices used in FCX’s reserve reports as of December 31, 2016 , were $34.26 per barrel of crude oil and $2.40 per one thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , FCX sold reserves in-place totaling 187 MMBOE, primarily representing all of its Deepwater GOM, onshore California and Haynesville properties. 182 Standardized Measure. The Standardized Measure (discounted at 10 percent) from production of proved oil and natural gas reserves has been developed in accordance with SEC guidelines. FCX estimated the quantity of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future periods in which they were expected to be produced based on year-end economic conditions. Estimates of future net revenues from FCX’s proved oil and gas properties and the present value thereof were made using the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials, which were held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations (excluding the impact of crude oil derivative contracts). Future gross revenues were reduced by estimated future operating costs (including production and ad valorem taxes) and future development and abandonment costs, all of which were based on current costs in effect at December 31, 2016 , and held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties. Future income taxes were calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre-tax future net cash flows, net of the tax basis of the respective oil and gas properties and utilization of FCX’s available tax carryforwards related to its oil and gas operations. The Standardized Measure related to proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016, follows:
