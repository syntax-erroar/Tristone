Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
============================================================

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 111 FREEPORT-McMoRan INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76 percent -owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper). Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. During 2016, FCX completed sales of its Africa mining operation held by FMC and substantially all of its oil and gas operations. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion. FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in companies owned less than 20 percent , and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded using the cost method. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset acquisitions and impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gains (losses) totaled $14 million in 2018 , $(5) million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016 . Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. FCX’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are primarily related to PT-FI’s commitment for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia; guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure and reclamation obligations, and customs duty taxes; and funds held as cash collateral for surety bonds related to plugging and abandonment obligations of certain oil and gas properties. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are comprised of time deposits and money market funds. Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). 112 Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products (e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process (i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, including, depending on the process, mining, haulage, milling, concentrating, smelting, leaching, solution extraction, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. 113 Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and three to 30 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Oil and Gas Properties. FCX follows the full cost method of accounting specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules whereby all costs associated with oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized into a cost center on a country-by-country basis. Such costs include internal general and administrative costs, such as payroll and related benefits and costs directly attributable to employees engaged in acquisition, exploration and development activities. General and administrative costs associated with production, operations, marketing and general corporate activities are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalized costs, along with estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and asset retirement costs that are not already included in oil and gas properties, net of related salvage value, are amortized to expense under the UOP method using engineers’ estimates of the related, by-country proved oil and natural gas reserves. 114 The costs of unproved oil and gas properties were excluded from amortization until the properties were evaluated. Costs were transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties were evaluated and proved oil and natural gas reserves were established or if impairment was determined. Unproved oil and gas properties were assessed periodically, at least annually, to determine whether impairment had occurred. FCX assessed unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties were individually insignificant. The assessment considered the following factors, among others: intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results and activity, the assignment of proved reserves, the economic viability of development if proved reserves were assigned and other current market conditions. During any period in which these factors indicated an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs were transferred to the full cost pool and were then subject to amortization. Including amounts determined to be impaired, FCX transferred $4.9 billion of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool in 2016. The transfer of costs into the amortization base involved a significant amount of judgment. Costs not subject to amortization consisted primarily of capitalized costs incurred for undeveloped acreage and wells in progress pending determination, together with capitalized interest for these projects. Following the completion of the sales of oil and gas properties discussed in Note 2, FCX had no unproved oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 or 2017. Interest costs totaling $7 million in 2016 were capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development. Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless the reduction causes a significant change in proved reserves, which, absent other factors, is generally described as a 25 percent or greater change, and significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves attributable to a cost center, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Under the SEC full cost accounting rules, FCX reviewed the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the full cost pool for impairment each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, and related deferred income taxes) for each cost center may not exceed a “ceiling” equal to:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
• the present value, discounted at 10 percent , of estimated future net cash flows from the related proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of estimated future income taxes; plus
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
• the cost of the related unproved properties not being amortized; plus
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
• the lower of cost or estimated fair value of the related unproved properties included in the costs being amortized (net of related tax effects).
============================================================

These rules require that FCX price its future oil and gas production at the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. FCX’s reference prices are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for oil and the Henry Hub price for natural gas. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. The reserve estimates exclude the effect of any crude oil and natural gas derivatives FCX has in place. The estimated future net cash flows also exclude future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of the oil and gas properties. The rules require an impairment if the capitalized costs exceed this “ceiling.” In 2016, net capitalized costs with respect to FCX’s proved oil and gas properties exceeded the related ceiling test limitation; therefore, impairment charges of $4.3 billion were recorded primarily because of the lower twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference oil price and reserve revisions. Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of a mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. 115 Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to outside law firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in earnings. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. 116 Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, FCX adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which did not result in any financial statement impacts or changes to FCX’s revenue recognition policies or processes as revenue is primarily derived from arrangements in which the transfer of control coincides with the fulfillment of performance obligations. FCX recognizes revenue for all of its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90 percent to 100 percent of the provisional payment is made upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold settlement prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average LBMA gold settlement price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e. , cash-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), cash-settled RSUs and cash-settled PSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model for SARs and FCX’s stock price for cash-settled RSUs and cash-settled PSUs. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards and SARs that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs and cash-settled PSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income (loss) per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (after deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be anti-dilutive. 117 Reconciliations of net income (loss) and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock. Stock options for 37 million shares of common stock were excluded in 2018 , 41 million in 2017 and 46 million in 2016 . New Accounting Standards. Following is a discussion of new accounting standards. Revenue Recognition. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to revenue recognition. FCX adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts that remain in force at the adoption date. The adoption of this standard did not result in any financial statement impacts or changes to FCX’s revenue recognition policies or processes as revenue is primarily derived from arrangements in which the transfer of control coincides with the fulfillment of performance obligations (refer to Revenue Recognition policy in this note). In connection with the adoption of the standard and consistent with FCX’s policy prior to adoption of the standard, FCX has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after control of goods has been transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost recorded in production and delivery costs on the consolidated statements of operations. 118 Financial Instruments. In January 2016, FASB issued an ASU that amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU makes limited changes to prior guidance and amends certain disclosure requirements. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adoption did not have a material impact on its financial statements. In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that requires entities to estimate all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model, which requires consideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. For public companies, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. FCX is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that will require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019, and elected the practical expedient allowing it to apply the provisions of the updated lease guidance at the January 1, 2019, effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented. FCX also elected an accounting policy to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and a purchase option that is not expected to be exercised. FCX completed an assessment of its lease portfolio, implemented a new information technology system, and designed processes and controls to account for its leases in accordance with the new standard. FCX has concluded that the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its financial statements. FCX will begin making the required lease disclosures under the ASU beginning with its March 31, 2019, quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, FASB issued an ASU that changes the classification and presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU requires that a statement of cash flows include the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adjusted its consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents. The impact of adopting this ASU for the years ended December 31 follows:

Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Cost. In March 2017, FASB issued an ASU that changes how entities with defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans present net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. This ASU requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item or items as other compensation costs for those employees who are receiving the benefit. In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization when applicable (i.e. , as a cost of inventory or an internally constructed asset). The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside of operating income. These other components of net periodic benefit cost are not eligible for capitalization, and FCX elected to include these other components in other income (expense), net. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and adjusted its presentation in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, to conform with the new guidance. The impact of adopting this ASU for the years ended December 31 follows:

120 Tax Reform Reclassification. In February 2018, FASB issued an ASU that allows entities to elect to reclassify the stranded income tax effects caused by the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings. This election applies to the U.S. federal income tax rate change from 35 percent to 21 percent. FCX elected to early adopt this standard effective July 1, 2018, which resulted in a one-time reclassification totaling $79 million from AOCI to retained earnings in third-quarter 2018. FCX has not elected to reclassify other “indirect” income tax effects of the Act stranded in AOCI. Any additional income tax effects stranded in AOCI will continue to pass through earnings in future periods as specific classes of AOCI items are reversed. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, FASB issued an ASU in connection with the disclosure framework project that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. FCX early adopted this ASU in third-quarter 2018, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements. Defined Benefit Plans . In August 2018, FASB issued an ASU in connection with the disclosure framework project that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. FCX early adopted this ASU in fourth-quarter 2018, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements. Reclassifications. As a result of adopting new accounting standards in 2018 (refer to New Accounting Standards in this Note) and the reclassification of assets held for sale (refer to Note 2), certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Pursuant to the previously announced divestment agreement and related documents, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), an Indonesian state-owned enterprise, acquired for cash consideration of $3.85 billion all of Rio Tinto plc's (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100 percent of FCX's interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI - formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which at the time owned 9.36 percent of PT-FI. Of the $3.85 billion in cash consideration, Rio Tinto received $3.5 billion , and FCX received $350 million . In addition, Rio Tinto paid FCX $107 million for its share of the 2018 joint venture cash flows. In connection with the transaction, an aggregate 40 percent share ownership in PT-FI was issued to PT Inalum and PTI (which is expected to be owned by PT Inalum and the provincial/regional government in Papua). Based on a subscription of PT Inalum’s rights to acquire for cash consideration of $3.5 billion all of Rio Tinto’s interests in the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of the entity (PT Rio Tinto Indonesia) that held Rio Tinto’s interest. After the transaction, PT Inalum’s (26.24 percent) and PTI’s (25.00 percent) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24 percent and FCX's share ownership totals 48.76 percent . The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e. , PT Inalum and PTI) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest in PT-FI is expected to approximate 81 percent from 2019 through 2022. The divestment agreement provides that FCX will indemnify PT Inalum and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to PT Inalum in a Jakarta, Indonesia tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. 121 FCX, PT-FI, PTI and PT Inalum entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether PT Inalum has substantive participating rights, and concluded that it has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders will retain the economics of the revenue and cost-sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 3A-02 (a), which provides for situations in which consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock. FCX also analyzed PT-FI’s acquisition of the Rio Tinto Joint Venture interests and concluded the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in mineral reserves and related long-lived mining assets. The acquisition was a single asset because substantially all of the acquired assets are linked to each other and cannot be physically removed without causing a significant diminution to the fair value of the other assets. PT-FI allocated the $3.5 billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair value estimates were based on, but not limited to, long-term metal price assumptions of $3.00 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold; expected future cash flows based on estimated reserve quantities; costs to produce and develop the related reserves; current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets; and appropriate discount rates using an estimated international cost of capital of 14 percent. The estimates were primarily based on significant inputs not observable in the market (as discussed above) and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:

122 FCX considered if the adjustment to capital in excess of par value was an indicator of impairment and after considering other factors, such as PT-FI’s historical results and projected undiscounted cash flows, concluded that it did not indicate a potential impairment at PT-FI. TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations. On November 16, 2016 , FCX completed the sale of its 70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound, both during the 24-month period beginning January 1, 2018. One-half of the proceeds from this transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan. The contingent consideration is considered a derivative, and the fair value will be adjusted through December 31, 2019. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was $57 million at December 31, 2018 , and $74 million at December 31, 2017. (Losses) gains resulting from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative ($(17) million in 2018, $61 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2016) are included in net (loss) income from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from fluctuations in cobalt and copper prices. Future changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in discontinued operations. In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported the results of operations of TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations because the disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations. Net (loss) income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:

Assets Held for Sale. As a result of the 2016 sale of TFHL, FCX planned to sell its effective 56 percent interest in Freeport Cobalt and its wholly owned Kisanfu exploration project. Freeport Cobalt includes the large-scale cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related sales and marketing business. Kisanfu is a copper and cobalt exploration project, located near Tenke in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The assets and liabilities of Freeport Cobalt and Kisanfu were previously classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, and a $110 million estimated loss on disposal was recognized in 2016 when these assets were classified as held for sale (included in net gain on sales of assets in the consolidated statements of operations). FCX is continuing to assess opportunities for its Kisanfu copper and cobalt exploration project, including development of the project on its own or a sale of all or a minority stake in the project. In 2017, a gain of $13 million was recorded to adjust the Kisanfu assets to their carrying value when they were initially classified as held for sale. In second-quarter 2018, management concluded it no longer believes that it is probable an outright sale will occur in the near term and the related assets and liabilities should no longer be classified as held for sale. Because of this conclusion, revisions to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, included a $90 million increase to property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, net, with an offsetting reduction in current assets held for sale, and a $27 million increase to deferred income taxes, with an offsetting reduction in current liabilities held for sale. FCX continues to market the Freeport Cobalt assets, but concluded that they no longer qualified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, during 2018, FCX recorded a gain of $97 million to adjust the Freeport Cobalt assets to their carrying value when they were initially classified as held for sale. During fourth-quarter 2018, FCX also recorded $48 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense that was suspended while the assets were held for sale from December 2016 through September 2018. The carrying amounts of Freeport Cobalt’s major classes of assets and liabilities, which were reclassified from held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, follow:

124 Morenci. In May 2016, FCX sold a 13 percent undivided interest in its Morenci unincorporated joint venture to SMM Morenci, Inc. for $1.0 billion in cash. FCX recorded a $576 million gain on the transaction and used losses to offset cash taxes on the transaction. A portion of the proceeds from the transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan and revolving credit facility. The Morenci unincorporated joint venture was owned 85 percent by FCX and 15 percent by Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (Sumitomo). As a result of the transaction, the unincorporated joint venture is owned 72 percent by FCX, 15 percent by Sumitomo and 13 percent by SMM Morenci, Inc. (an affiliate of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co, Ltd.). Timok. In May 2016, FMC sold an interest in the Timok exploration project in Serbia to Global Reservoir Minerals Inc. (now known as Nevsun Resources, Ltd.) for consideration of $135 million in cash and contingent consideration of up to $107 million payable to FCX in stages upon achievement of defined development milestones. As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of $133 million in 2016, and no amounts were recorded for contingent consideration under the loss recovery approach. A portion of the proceeds from the transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term loan. Oil and Gas Operations. In 2018, FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G) disposed of certain property interests that resulted in the recognition of a gain of $27 million , primarily associated with the abandonment obligations that were assumed by the acquirer. In 2017, FM O&G sold certain property interests for cash consideration of $80 million (before closing adjustments). Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales resulted in the recognition of gains of $49 million in 2017 . In December 2016, FM O&G completed the sale of its onshore California oil and gas properties to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC (Sentinel) for cash consideration of $592 million (before closing adjustments from the July 1, 2016, effective date) and contingent consideration of up to $150 million , consisting of $50 million per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over $70 per barrel in each of these calendar years. The contingent consideration is considered a derivative, and the fair value will be adjusted through the year 2020. The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative (included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was $16 million at December 31, 2018 , and $34 million at December 31, 2017 . The contingent consideration of $50 million for 2018 was realized because the average Brent crude oil price exceeded $70 per barrel for the year and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Future changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative will continue to be recorded in operating income. Sentinel assumed abandonment obligations associated with the properties. In December 2016, FM O&G completed the sale of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil and gas properties to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for cash consideration of $2.0 billion (before closing adjustments from the August 1, 2016, effective date) and up to $150 million in contingent payments. The contingent payments were recorded under the loss recovery approach, whereby contingent gains are recorded up to the amount of any loss on the sale, and reduced the loss on the sale in 2016. The contingent payments were included in other current assets ($27 million) and other assets ($116 million) at December 31, 2018, and in other current assets ($24 million) and other assets ($126 million) at December 31, 2017, in the consolidated balance sheets. The contingent payments will be received over time ($7 million was collected in 2018) as Anadarko realizes future cash flows in connection with a third-party production handling agreement for an offshore platform. Anadarko assumed abandonment obligations associated with these properties. A portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used to repay FCX’s remaining outstanding borrowings under its unsecured bank term loan. Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales of the Deepwater GOM and onshore California oil and gas properties required gain (loss) recognition (net loss of $9 million in 2016, which was net of $150 million for contingent payments associated with the Deepwater GOM sale and $33 million for the fair value of contingent consideration from the onshore California sale) because of their significance to the full cost pool. In connection with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, FM O&G entered into an agreement to amend the terms of the Plains Offshore Operations Inc. Preferred Stock that was reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest on FCX’s financial statements. The amendment provided FM O&G the right to call these securities for $582 million . FM O&G exercised this option in December 2016 and recorded a $199 million gain on redemption to retained earnings. 125 In July 2016, FM O&G sold its Haynesville shale assets for cash consideration of $87 million , before closing adjustments. In June 2016, FM O&G sold certain oil and gas royalty interests to Black Stone Minerals, L.P. for cash consideration of $102 million , before closing adjustments. Under the full cost accounting rules, the proceeds from these transactions were recorded as a reduction of capitalized oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition in 2016 because the reserves were not significant to the full cost pool.

FCX had $10.6 billion in intercompany loans to FM O&G outstanding at December 31, 2018 , which were fully impaired. Joint Ventures. FCX has the following unincorporated joint ventures. Former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. On December 21, 2018, PT-FI acquired Rio Tinto’s interest in the joint venture and is consolidating 100 percent of the Indonesia operations (refer to Note 2 for discussion of the PT-FI divestment). Pursuant to Rio Tinto’s previous joint venture agreement with PT-FI, Rio Tinto had a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2022 in Block A of PT-FI’s former Contract of Work (COW), and, after 2022, a 40 percent interest in all production from Block A.

============================================================

Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings outstanding and $13 million in letters of credit issued under FCX’s revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately $3.5 billion , of which approximately $1.5 billion could be used for additional letters of credit. In April 2018, FCX, PT-FI and FM O&G LLC entered into a new $3.5 billion , five -year, unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced FCX’s prior revolving credit facility (scheduled to mature on May 31, 2019). The new revolving credit facility is available until April 20, 2023, with $500 million available to PT-FI, and up to $1.5 billion available in letters of credit, and has a substantially similar structure and terms as the prior revolving credit facility. Interest on loans made under the new revolving credit facility is, at the option of FCX, determined based on the adjusted London Interbank Offered rate (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (each as defined in the new revolving credit facility) plus a spread to be determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings. Cerro Verde Credit Facility. In March 2014, Cerro Verde entered into a five -year, $1.8 billion senior unsecured credit facility that is nonrecourse to FCX and the other shareholders of Cerro Verde. In June 2017, Cerro Verde’s credit facility was amended (balance outstanding at the time of amendment was $1.275 billion) to increase the commitment by $225 million to $1.5 billion , to modify the amortization schedule and to extend the maturity date to June 19, 2022. The amended credit facility amortizes in four installments, with $225 million due on December 31, 2020 (of which $5 million was prepaid during 2018 and $220 million was prepaid during 2017), $225 million due on June 30, 2021 (which was fully prepaid during 2018), $525 million due on December 31, 2021 (of which $20 million was prepaid during 2018), and the remaining balance due on the maturity date of June 19, 2022. All other terms, including the interest rates, remain the same. Interest under the term loan is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s credit facility was 4.42 percent at December 31, 2018. 129 Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans. In December 2014, Cerro Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its shareholders for borrowings up to $800 million . In June 2017, Cerro Verde used the proceeds from its amended credit facility plus available cash to repay the balance of its outstanding shareholder loans. The remaining availability for borrowings under these agreements totals $200 million . Senior Notes issued by FCX. In December 2016, FCX completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation associated with FM O&G LLC senior notes. Holders representing 89 percent of the outstanding FM O&G LLC senior notes tendered their notes and received new FCX senior notes. Each series of newly issued FCX senior notes have an interest rate that is identical to the interest rate of the applicable series of FM O&G LLC senior notes. The newly issued FCX senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of FCX and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of FCX. A summary of the tenders follows:

============================================================

Principal Amount Outstanding Principal Amount Tendered Book Value of New FCX Senior Notes 6.125% Senior Notes due 2019 $$$6½% Senior Notes due 2020 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 6 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2023 $2,342 $2,091 $2,228
============================================================

The principal amounts were increased by $151 million to reflect the remaining unamortized acquisition-date fair market value adjustments associated with the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions. In addition, FCX paid $14 million in cash consideration for FM O&G LLC’s senior notes that were tendered, which reduced the book value of the new FCX senior notes. All of these senior notes, except the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 and the 6 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2023, were redeemed during 2017 and the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 were redeemed during 2018 (refer to Early Extinguishment and Exchanges of Debt in this note). The 6 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2023 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to February 15, 2020, and at a specified redemption price thereafter. As of December 31, 2018, the book value of these senior notes totaled $768 million , which reflects the remaining unamortized acquisition-date fair market value adjustments ($46 million) and the cash consideration ($6 million) that are being amortized over the term of these senior notes and recorded as a net reduction of interest expense. In November 2014, FCX sold $750 million of 2.30% Senior Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid in 2017), $600 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021, $850 million of 4.55% Senior Notes due 2024 and $800 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due 2034 for total net proceeds of $2.97 billion . In March 2013, in connection with the financing of the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions, FCX issued $6.5 billion of unsecured senior notes in four tranches. FCX sold $1.5 billion of 2.375% Senior Notes due March 2018 (which matured and were repaid in 2018), $1.0 billion of 3.100% Senior Notes due March 2020, $2.0 billion of 3.875% Senior Notes due March 2023 and $2.0 billion of 5.450% Senior Notes due March 2043 for total net proceeds of $6.4 billion . In February 2012, FCX sold $500 million of 2.15% Senior Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid in 2017) and $2.0 billion of 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022 for total net proceeds of $2.47 billion . The 3.100% Senior Notes due 2020 and 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021 are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price. The senior notes listed below are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a make-whole redemption price prior to the dates stated below, and beginning on the dates stated below at 100 percent of principal.

Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes the periodic development of asset allocation studies and review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment committee considers these studies in the formal establishment of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s investment objective emphasizes diversification through both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various asset classes and the selection of investment managers whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager, is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset allocation approximates 41 percent equity investments (primarily global equities), 51 percent fixed income (primarily long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt securities) and 8 percent alternative investments (private real estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity). 132 The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 6.5 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2019. The 6.5 percent estimation was based on a passive return on a compound basis of 6.0 percent and a premium for active management of 0.5 percent reflecting the target asset allocation and current investment array. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments for service to date together with the Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve - Above Mean Yield is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve consists of spot (i.e. , zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which the participant completed 25 years of credited service. The annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesian rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesian national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesian pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 14,409 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2018 , and 13,480 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2017 . Indonesian labor laws require that companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits related to this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7.75 percent per annum beginning January 1, 2019. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Mercer Indonesian zero coupon bond yield curve derived from the Indonesian Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans. Information for those plans where the projected benefit obligations and the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets follows:

============================================================

During 2018, the actuarial gain of $124 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 3.70 percent to 4.40 percent ($205 million), partially offset by new census data incorporated into the valuations ($33 million) and updated demographic assumptions ($49 million) mainly resulting from mortality updates. During 2017, the actuarial loss of $188 million for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the decrease in the discount rate from 4.40 percent to 3.70 percent and the update to the actuarial basis for lump sum conversions. During 2018, the actuarial gain of $19 million for the PT-FI pension plan primarily resulted from the increase in the discount rate from 6.75 percent to 8.25 percent and demographic experience gains. During 2017, the actuarial gain of $61 million resulted primarily because of the workforce reduction during 2017, experience gains and a decline in the rate of compensation increase, partially offset by the decrease in the discount rate from 8.25 percent to 6.75 percent . 134 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s pension plans for the years ended December 31 follow:

Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to significant observable inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 135 A summary of the fair value for pension plan assets, including those measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, associated with the FCX plans follows:

============================================================

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. 136 Commingled/collective funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the real estate property fund) require up to a 60-day notice for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, who have knowledge and expertise about the current market values of real property in the same vicinity as the investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash. Fixed income investments include government and corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs. Common stocks included in global large-cap equity securities and preferred stocks included in other investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Private equity investments are valued at NAV using information from general partners and have inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect the ability to sell the investments at their NAV in the near term. A summary of the fair value hierarchy for pension plan assets associated with the PT-FI plan follows:

Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Common stocks, government bonds and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 137 The expected benefit payments for FCX’s and PT-FI’s pension plans follow:

Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary among plans, and many plans require contributions from retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement benefits is accrued during the years employees render service. The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $13 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $115 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2018 , and a current portion of $14 million and a long-term portion of $129 million at December 31, 2017 . The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for these plans, which was determined on the same basis as FCX’s pension plans, was 4.20 percent at December 31, 2018 , and 3.50 percent at December 31, 2017 . Expected benefit payments for these plans total $13 million for 2019 , $13 million for 2020 , $13 million for 2021 , $12 million for 2022 , $11 million for 2023 and $47 million for 2024 through 2028 . The net periodic benefit cost charged to operations for FCX’s postretirement benefits (primarily for interest costs) totaled $5 million in 2018 , $5 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016 . The discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for FCX’s postretirement benefits was 3.50 percent in 2018 , 3.80 percent in 2017 and 4.10 percent in 2016 . The medical-care trend rates assumed the first year trend rate was 7.75 percent at December 31, 2018 , which declines over the next 15 years with an ultimate trend rate of 4.25 percent . FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit consisted of a current portion of $6 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $39 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2018 , and a current portion of $5 million and a long-term portion of $38 million at December 31, 2017 . FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options. FCX contributes to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of employee pre-tax deferral contributions up to certain limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $45 million at December 31, 2018 , and $46 million at December 31, 2017 , all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans totaled $75 million in 2018 (none of which was capitalized), $65 million in 2017 (none of which was capitalized) and $78 million in 2016 (of which $4 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties). FCX has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in operating costs. Restructuring Charges. As a result of the first-quarter 2017 regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding long-term investment stability, PT-FI took actions to adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and slow investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. These actions included workforce reductions through furlough and voluntary retirement programs. Following the furlough and voluntary retirement programs, a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under the existing Indonesian 138 laws and regulations. As a result, PT-FI recorded charges in 2017 to production costs of $120 million , and selling, general and administrative costs of $5 million for employee severance and related costs, and a pension curtailment loss of $4 million in production costs. In early 2016, FCX restructured its oil and gas business to reduce costs and in late 2016, FCX sold substantially all of its remaining oil and gas properties. As a result, FCX recorded charges of $85 million to selling, general and administrative expenses and $6 million to production costs for net restructuring-related costs in 2016. NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion shares, consisting of 3.0 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock. Common Stock. In November 2016, FCX completed a $1.5 billion registered at-the-market equity offering of common stock that was announced on July 27, 2016. FCX sold 116.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $12.87 per share, which generated gross proceeds of $1.5 billion (net proceeds of $1.48 billion after $15 million of commissions and expenses). During 2016, FCX issued 48.1 million shares of its common stock (with a value of $540 million , excluding $5 million of commissions paid by FCX) in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts. Also during 2016, FCX negotiated private exchange transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, whereby 27.7 million shares of FCX’s common stock were issued (with an aggregate value of $311 million), in exchange for $369 million principal amount of FCX’s senior notes. From January 1, 2016, through January 5, 2016, FCX sold 4.3 million shares of its common stock, which generated proceeds of $29 million (after $0.3 million of commissions and expenses). FCX used the proceeds to repay indebtedness. In February 2018, FCX’s Board of Directors (the Board) reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s common stock with an annual rate of $0.20 per share. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board and will depend on FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Stock options granted prior to 2018 generally vest in 25 percent annual increments and beginning in 2018 awards granted vest in 33 percent annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control.

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life. When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is calculated using the annual dividend (excluding supplemental dividends) at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. 140 Information related to stock options during the years ended December 31 follows:

a. Rounds to less than $1 million. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had $23 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years . Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s executive officers were granted PSUs that vest after three years. For the PSUs granted in 2017 and 2016, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive officers will be determined based on (i) FCX’s achievement of certain financial and operational performance metrics and (ii) FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the shareholder return of a peer group. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.6 million for 2017 and 1.5 million for 2016, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 175 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial and operating metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to a peer group. For the PSUs granted in 2018, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive officers will be determined based on (i) FCX’s achievement of certain financial metrics and (ii) FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the shareholder return of a peer group. The total grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were 0.5 million for 2018, of which the executive officers will earn (i) between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target shares based on achievement of financial metrics and (ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared to a peer group. All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such, FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to expense at the time the financial and operational, if applicable, metrics are established. FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years to certain employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors. Beginning in December 2015, RSUs granted to directors vest on the first anniversary of the grant. Prior to December 2015, RSUs granted to directors generally vest over a period of four years. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest. For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying termination within one year following a change of control. Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests.

As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had $6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized over approximately 1.1 years . Cash-Settled RSUs and PSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally vest over three years of service. The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control (as defined in the award agreements). In 2015, certain members of FM O&G’s senior management were granted cash-settled PSUs that vested over three years. The total grant date target shares related to the 2015 cash-settled PSU grants were 582 thousand shares, of which FM O&G’s senior management earned a total of 487 thousand shares at maturity during 2018 based on the achievement of applicable performance goals. The cash-settled RSUs and PSUs are classified as liability awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period until the vesting dates. Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs and PSUs accrue and are paid if the award vests. A summary of outstanding cash-settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2018 , and activity during the year ended December 31, 2018 , follows:

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $1.8 billion that will expire between 2019 and 2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of $6.0 billion that expire between 2036 and 2037, (iii) U.S. state net operating losses of $10.5 billion that expire between 2019 and 2038, (iv) Spanish net operating losses of $537 million that can be carried forward indefinitely and (v) Indonesian net operating losses of $975 million that expire between 2020 and 2025. 144 Valuation Allowance. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2018 , including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.5 billion at December 31, 2018 , and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2017 , and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net operating losses, foreign net operating losses and substantially all of its U.S. state net operating losses. FCX’s valuation allowances at December 31, 2017 , also covered all of its U.S. federal capital losses. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 . FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and foreign deferred tax assets totaled $2.2 billion and $458 million , respectively, at December 31, 2018 . Net operating losses and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and provides a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets, until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable income against which any of the assets, credits or net operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits or net operating losses that can be implemented. The $68 million net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2018 primarily related to decreases totaling $315 million in U.S. foreign tax credits associated with expirations and 2017 tax reform adjustments, and $45 million in U.S. federal net operating losses associated with 2018 usage and 2017 tax reform adjustments, partly offset by a $244 million increase in foreign net operating losses for which no benefit is expected to be realized. 2017 U.S. Tax Reform. The Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, included significant modifications to then-existing U.S. tax laws and created many new complex tax provisions. The Act reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent , eliminated the corporate AMT, provided for a refund of AMT credits, maintained hard minerals percentage depletion, allowed for immediate expensing of certain qualified property and generally broadened the tax base. The Act also created a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), created anti-base erosion rules that require companies to pay a minimum tax on foreign earnings and may disallow certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties. In December 2018, FCX completed its analysis of the Act and recognized benefits totaling $123 million associated with AMT credit refunds. In 2017, FCX recorded net tax benefits related to specific provisions of the Act totaling $393 million , reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits through 2021 ($272 million) and a decrease in corporate income tax rates ($121 million). Elimination of Corporate AMT and Refund of AMT Credits. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate AMT was repealed. FCX has historically incurred an AMT liability in excess of regular tax liability, resulting in accumulated AMT credits totaling $490 million as of December 31, 2017. The Act allows the use of existing corporate AMT credits to offset regular tax liability for tax years after December 31, 2017. AMT credits in excess of regular liability are refundable on tax returns for the years 2018 through 2021. Prior to the Act, FCX recognized a $110 million benefit for AMT credits expected to be refunded. As a result of the Act, FCX recognized a provisional net benefit of $272 million in 2017, consisting of a $380 million tax benefit for historical AMT credits expected to be refunded, partially offset by a $108 million tax charge to establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. At December 31, 2018, FCX recognized an additional $123 million net benefit for historical AMT credits consisting of $51 million in additional refundable credits and $72 million in reduction to reserves. 145 Reduction in Corporate Income Tax Rate. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent . While applicable for years after December 31, 2017, existing income tax accounting guidance requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. In fourth-quarter 2017, FCX recognized this change in the federal statutory rate and recorded a provisional net benefit of $121 million , consisting of a $1.1 billion tax benefit associated with changes in related valuation allowances, partly offset by a $975 million tax charge related to existing net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities. In fourth-quarter 2018, FCX finalized the impact of this change in federal statutory rate resulting in a net zero impact, consisting of a $32 million tax benefit associated with changes in related valuation allowances offset by a $32 million tax charge related to existing net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Transition Tax on Previously Deferred Foreign Earnings. Under the Act, U.S. shareholders owning at least 10 percent of a foreign subsidiary generally must recognize taxable income equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated post-1986 historical Earnings and Profits (E&P). The portion of any E&P associated with cash or cash equivalents is taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent , while any remaining E&P is taxed at a reduced rate of 8 percent . The resulting tax liability (Transition Tax) may be reduced by available foreign tax credits. Because FCX operates in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates in excess of the U.S. historical statutory tax rate of 35 percent , the December 31, 2017, Transition Tax was fully offset by foreign tax credits generated in 2017. During fourth-quarter 2018, additional guidance was released by the IRS clarifying the computation of Transition Tax liability. As a result of this additional guidance, FCX recognized a $29 million tax charge related to Transition Tax for 2018. Anti-Base Erosion Rules. For tax years that begin after December 31, 2017, applicable taxpayers are required to pay the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). BEAT is an alternative tax calculation that disallows deduction of certain amounts paid or accrued by a U.S. taxpayer to a foreign related party. The BEAT provisions do not currently impact FCX’s computation of U.S. federal taxable income. The Act also included provisions to tax a new class of income called Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). Under the new GILTI provisions, FCX will use U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in current and future tax years against income that would otherwise not generate a net tax liability absent the availability of net operating losses. As a result, FCX does not consider GILTI to be a source of income against which a benefit for U.S. federal net operating losses can be realized. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, FCX is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (i) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (ii) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Executive Compensation Limitation. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, tax deductible compensation of covered employees is limited to $1 million . In addition, the definition of covered employees is revised to include the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, and the three other highest paid officers. If an individual is a covered employee for a tax year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all future years. Under a transition rule, the changes do not apply to any remuneration under specified contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. During fourth-quarter 2018, FCX determined that only immaterial adjustments were needed in relation to future disallowance of deferred executive compensation balances as of December 31, 2017. Other. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX has offset $5.4 billion of foreign source income with U.S. source losses. Under existing U.S. tax law, FCX has the ability to re-characterize $5.4 billion of future U.S. source income into foreign source income. While utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits is dependent upon FCX generating future U.S. tax liabilities within the carryforward period, this re-sourcing may permit FCX to utilize up to $1.1 billion of the $1.8 billion foreign tax credits that would otherwise expire unused. Other Events. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with closing the transaction, the Indonesian government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to a 25 percent corporate income tax rate and a 10 percent profits tax on net income beginning in 2019. As a result of the change in statutory tax rate applicable to deferred income tax liabilities, during fourth-quarter 2018, FCX recognized a tax credit of $504 million . 146 SUNAT, the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator for the period December 2006 to December 2013, which Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Cerro Verde royalty dispute and net charges recorded in 2018 and 2017. In December 2016, the Peruvian parliament passed tax legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from 4.1 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent , and the dividend tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent . Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. In September 2014, the Chilean legislature approved a tax reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s share of income from Chilean operations was subject to an effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax reform package, FCX’s Chilean operation is subject to the “Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of income from El Abra being subject to progressively increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019 and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by the Chilean legislature so that the 35 percent rate continues through 2021 increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter. In 2010, the Chilean legislature approved an increase in mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were 4 percent for the years 2013 through 2017. Beginning in 2018, and through 2023, rates moved to a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a defined operational margin). Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income and expense rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets was $186 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and other related mining taxes, and $22 million at December 31, 2017, and $19 million at December 31, 2016. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $404 million at December 31, 2018 , included $296 million ($147 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX ’ s tax treatment of social welfare payments and cost recovery methods. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with royalties and other related mining taxes and AMT credit refunds. 147 Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the lapse of statute of limitations were primarily related to social welfare payments. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during 2019 , FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. FCX or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation, if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 26 U.S. states.

============================================================

148 Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and unescalated basis) total $132 million in 2019 , $117 million in 2020 , $119 million in 2021 , $88 million in 2022 , $100 million in 2023 and $2.7 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $1.5 billion , including $1.4 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and unescalated basis, these obligations totaled $3.3 billion . FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion on an undiscounted and unescalated basis. At December 31, 2018 , the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018 . FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping are expected to continue for many years in the future. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, four other companies and the City of New York that EPA considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties entered an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial options. The parties ’ RI/FS work under the AOC and their efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. EPA recently identified eight additional parties as PRPs for the creek. The draft RI was submitted to EPA in November 2016, and the draft FS is expected to be submitted to EPA by the end of 2020. EPA is not expected to propose a final remedy until after the RI/FS is completed, but has recently considered allowing for interim remedial measures as suggested by the PRPs. EPA’s remedial decision could be made in 2021 and remedial design could begin in 2022, with the actual remediation construction starting several years later. The actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. During 2017, FCX recorded charges of $138 million for revised cost estimates for the Newtown Creek environmental obligation. Historical Smelter Sites . FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate onsite and offsite conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. 149 From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. On January 30, 2017, a class action titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte, Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax Realty Development, Inc. , Docket No. 734-17, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it remains pending. In December 2017, the plaintiffs amended their complaint and FCX was dismissed as a defendant and FMC was added as a defendant to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that USMR generated and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly released contaminants onsite and offsite through discharges to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades and seeks unspecified damages for economic losses, including loss of property value, medical monitoring, punitive damages and other damages. In October 2018, the magistrate judge denied the plaintiffs’ July 2018 request to amend the complaint to rejoin FCX as a defendant, and the plaintiffs have appealed that decision. FCX continues to vigorously defend this matter. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX increased its associated environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation by recording a $59 million charge to operating income in 2017. Additional sampling and analysis occurred through 2018 and is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental remediation obligation in future periods. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1970s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. In January 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. The settlement terms are outlined in a Consent Decree that was filed on January 17, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Under the Consent Decree, which the U.S. Government valued at over $600 million , the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. Based on updated cash flow and timing estimates, FCX reduced its associated obligation by recording a $41 million credit to operating income in 2017 after receiving court approval of the Consent Decree. In addition to uranium activities on tribal lands, FCX is conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on over 10,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM may provide no further action determinations for undisturbed claims or requests for additional assessment or reclamation activities for others. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows:

============================================================

============================================================

150 ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $1.2 billion , of which $703 million was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had trust assets totaling $180 million (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $545 million . Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC). In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. In 2013, the WQCC adopted Supplemental Permitting Requirements for Copper Mining Facilities, which became effective on December 1, 2013, and specify closure requirements for copper mine facilities. The rules were adopted after an extensive stakeholder process in which FCX participated and were jointly supported by FCX and NMED. The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the rules in 2018, following a challenge by certain environmental organizations and the New Mexico Attorney General. Finalized closure plans that meet the requirements of these rules will be submitted in 2019 and will result in material increases in closure costs for FCX’s New Mexico operations. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans describing the reclamation to be performed following cessation of mining operations. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $450 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona properties are subject to regulatory oversight in several areas. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards at an applicable point of compliance well or location during both operations and closure. The APP program also may require mitigation and discharge reduction or elimination of some discharges. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the cost to implement the closure strategy. An APP application specifies closure obligations, including post-closure monitoring and maintenance. A more detailed closure plan must be submitted within 90 days after a permitted entity notifies ADEQ of its intent to cease operations. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. In 151 2014, the state enacted legislation requiring closure costs for facilities covered by APPs to be updated no more frequently than every six years and financial assurance mechanisms to be updated no more frequently than every two years. In 2016, ADEQ approved a closure plan update for Sierrita, which resulted in increased closure costs. FCX will continue updating its closure strategy and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites and intends to submit an updated tailings dam system closure cost for Morenci in April 2019. FCX expects to update the closure strategy and closure costs for Morenci’s stockpiles in 2020. FCX intends to update Bagdad closure costs in 2021. FCX has also proposed a closure strategy and closure costs for a former leach stockpile at Bisbee (a discontinued operation), which is currently under review by ADEQ. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. During 2017, Safford submitted an update to its reclamation plan to include the Lone Star expansion, which increased its reclamation costs. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $367 million for its Arizona operations. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. During 2016, at the request of the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining & Safety, the Climax mine submitted a revised cost estimate for its current reclamation plan, which did not materially change the closure plan cost. In 2017, Henderson began considering alternatives for the closure of the tailings facility and, in 2018, began evaluating potential options for long-term water treatment, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. As of December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $61 million for its Colorado operations. In 2019, a bill has been introduced in the Colorado legislature that requires financial assurance for long-term water management and eliminates the potential for future permits for mining sites that include long-term water management as part of the closure strategy. The long-term water management component of the bill will apply to Climax and Henderson operations and AROs. Chilean Reclamation and Closure Programs. In July 2011, the Chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which established new requirements for closure plans. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, in November 2018, FCX’s El Abra operation submitted an updated plan with closure cost estimates based on the existing approved closure plan. Approval is expected in 2019. This update will not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $63 million for its El Abra operation. Peruvian Reclamation and Closure Programs . Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the five year closure plan and cost update required by the Mine Closure Law, the latest closure plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion were submitted to the Peruvian regulatory authorities in 2017 and approved in February 2018. This update did not result in a material increase to closure costs. At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $105 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesian Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. At the end of 2016, PT-FI revised its estimates for an overburden stockpile to address ongoing erosion that occurred during 2016, a design change that increased the volume and updated cost estimates reflecting more recent productivity and costs at the overburden stockpile, which resulted in an increase in the ARO of $372 million . At December 31, 2018 , FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $991 million for its PT-FI operations. PT-FI is currently mining in the final phase of the Grasberg 152 open pit and expects to transition to the underground mine in the first half of 2019. As a result, beginning in 2019, any adjustments to the costs for the overburden stockpile will impact earnings. In December 2009, PT-FI submitted its revised mine closure plan to the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources for review and addressed comments received during the course of this review process. In December 2010, the Indonesian government issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In December 2018, PT-FI, in conjunction with the issuance of the IUPK, submitted a revised mine closure plan to reflect the extension of operations to 2041. At December 31, 2018 , PT-FI funded $90 million into a restricted time deposit account for mine closure guarantees and $11 million for reclamation guarantees. In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) notified PT-FI of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the MOEF indicated are not reflected in its environmental permit. The MOEF also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, and tailings management. In December 2018, the MOEF issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. The remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and, in a few situations, PT-FI has agreed with the MOEF on an appropriate multi-year work plan, including the closure of an overburden stockpile. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large-scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The MOEF issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by PT-FI that would target continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant long-term costs to PT-FI’s operations. The new framework enables PT-FI to maintain compliance with site-specific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the MOEF. In 2018, PT-FI recorded a $32 million charge for assessments of prior period permit fees with the MOEF. Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions in 2016, 2017 and 2018, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas include offshore California and onshore in South Louisiana as of December 31, 2018 . FM O&G AROs cover approximately 210 wells and 120 platforms and other structures. At December 31, 2018 , FM O&G had accrued $476 million associated with its AROs. Litigation. FCX is involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business or are associated with environmental issues as discussed in this note under “Environmental.” FCX is also involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. FM O&G LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, is a defendant in a purported class action titled David Garcia v. Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC filed on April 1, 2016, in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Barbara (Case No. 16CV01305) and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the District Court). The plaintiff, a former FM O&G LLC employee who worked on offshore production platforms in federal waters, alleged violations of various California wage and hour laws and sought relief for past wages, overtime, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees. The case was dismissed by the District Court on the basis that federal law, not state law, applied, and the complaint alleged no violations of federal law. The dismissal was appealed by the plaintiff to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the case is currently stayed in deference to the ongoing appeal of a similar case. Based on recent developments, FCX has concluded that its exposure in the Garcia case is not material to its consolidated financial statements. 153 Asbestos and Talc Claims. Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a recent significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. In these cases, plaintiffs allege serious health risks and often fatal diseases, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer, allegedly caused by long-term use of talc-based cosmetic and personal care products. Nationwide trial results in these cases have ranged from outright dismissals to large jury awards of both compensatory and punitive damages. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, is one of those targets. One of CAMC’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Cyprus Mines Corporation, was involved in talc mining until 1992 when it exited that business. CAMC has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against the ultimate successor to the business, which has acknowledged those indemnification obligations, and has taken responsibility for all cases tendered to it to date. However, on February 13, 2019, the indemnitor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and CAMC is in the very early stages of evaluating the potential implications of that filing. To date, no judgments have been rendered against CAMC, and FCX believes that CAMC has strong defenses. Accordingly, FCX currently believes the losses, if any, related to these cases, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. Tax and Other Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible. Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute. SUNAT has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2013. Cerro Verde has contested each of these assessments because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing such minerals. No assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 under its new 15 -year stability agreement. Since 2014, Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for the period from December 2006 through December 2008 under an installment program ($188 million paid by Cerro Verde through December 31, 2018). Cerro Verde will also begin making monthly payments beginning in second-quarter 2019 under a 66-month payment plan related to assessments for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In October 2017, the Peruvian Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were proper under Peruvian law. As a result of the unfavorable Peruvian Supreme Court ruling, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $186 million in 2017 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $348 million and $7 million of net tax charges, net of $169 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for royalty assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2013, penalties and interest related to assessments for the period December 2006 through the year 2008, and other related items that Cerro Verde would have incurred under the view that its concentrator was not stabilized. 154 In September 2018, the Peruvian Tax Tribunal denied Cerro Verde’s request to waive penalties and interest for the period January 2009 through September 2011. In December 2018, Cerro Verde elected not to appeal the Peruvian Tax Tribunal’s decisions and is continuing to evaluate alternative strategies to defend its rights, including international arbitration. As a result, Cerro Verde recorded net charges of $211 million in 2018 (consisting of pre-tax charges of $420 million , net of $18 million of tax benefits and $191 million of noncontrolling interests) primarily for penalties and interest related to assessments for the years 2009 through 2013 and other related items. Cerro Verde also recognized a net gain of $16 million (consisting of pre-tax gains of $14 million and net tax benefits of $17 million , net of $15 million in noncontrolling interests) in 2018 for refunds received for the overpayment of special (voluntary) levies (GEM) for the period October 2012 through the year 2013. Cerro Verde has also submitted a refund request for the remainder of the GEM assessments for the period October 2011 through September 2012 totaling $57 million , but will not record a receivable for this amount until the request is granted by SUNAT. As of December 31, 2018, Cerro Verde has recorded all of its exposure associated with its royalty dispute with the Peruvian tax authorities and will continue to record interest charges until all obligations are settled. Any future recoveries would be recorded when collected. A summary of the charges recorded in 2018 and 2017 for the Cerro Verde royalty dispute follows:

============================================================

Other Peruvian Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
============================================================

As of December 31, 2018 , Cerro Verde had paid $386 million on these disputed tax assessments. A reserve has been applied against these payments totaling $203 million , resulting in a net receivable of $183 million (included in other assets), which Cerro Verde believes is collectible. 155 Indonesia Tax Matters. PT-FI has received assessments from the Indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes and interest related to various audit exceptions for income and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the assessments because it believes it has properly determined and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water and withholding tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesian government’s previous imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty that PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018 (refer to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Tax Year Tax Assessment Interest Assessment Total $$$2007 2008, 2010 to 2011 2012 — 2013 2014 2015 — 2016 $1,016 $$1,304
============================================================

As of December 31, 2018 , PT-FI had paid $493 million (included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which it believes is collectible. PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through December 2018. PT-FI has filed or will file appeals of these assessments with the Indonesia Tax Court. During the first half of 2018 and in fourth-quarter 2018, the Indonesia Tax Court ruled partially in favor of PT-FI with respect to assessments for the period January 2016 through April 2017 by reducing these assessments from $80 million , including penalties, to $48 million , including penalties (based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2018), or an approximate 40 percent reduction. During 2017, PT-FI filed reconsideration request petitions to the Indonesia Supreme Court with respect to assessments for the period from January 2011 through December 2015; and in second-quarter 2018, filed reconsideration request petitions with respect to the Indonesia Tax Court decisions related to the assessments for the period from January 2016 through April 2016. In second-quarter 2018, the Indonesia Supreme Court issued favorable decisions relating to surface water tax assessments for the period January 2011 through July 2015. The Indonesia Supreme Court ruling concluded that PT-FI and the Indonesian government are bound by PT-FI’s former COW, which is lex specialis, and prevails as the law for the parties to the former COW that should be carried out in good faith. As a result, FCX estimates the total amount of the assessments, including penalties, (based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2018) for the period from August 2015 through December 2018 totals $174 million , including $87 million in penalties. In accordance with its IUPK discussed in Note 13, PT-FI is obligated to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019. In addition, PT-FI has offered to pay one trillion rupiah ($69 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018) to settle historical disputes regarding surface water taxes, which was charged to production and delivery costs in December 2018. In September 2018, PT-FI received an unfavorable decision from the Indonesian Tax Court with respect to its appeal of disallowed items on its 2012 corporate income tax return. The most significant disallowed item relates to the tax treatment of mine development costs. A similar decision on PT-FI’s 2014 corporate income tax return was announced in October 2018. PT-FI has filed or will file appeals related to these decisions to the Indonesian Supreme Court because it believes the former COW is explicit about the tax treatment associated with mine development costs. No adjustments have been recorded for this matter as of December 31, 2018, because FCX believes PT-FI has properly determined and paid its taxes. As of December 31, 2018 , PT-FI had long-term receivables totaling approximately $350 million related to this matter, and no reserves have been recorded for these receivables. FCX estimates the potential exposure for penalties for the years 2013, 2016 and 2017, in which the Indonesian tax authorities may assert that PT-FI has underpaid income taxes, totals $251 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. 156 In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government (the 2017 MOU) confirming that the former COW would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK and investment stability agreement. In the 2017 MOU, PT-FI agreed to continue to pay a 5 percent export duty during this period. Subsequently, the Customs Office of the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5 percent export duty agreed to under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations, which PT-FI paid under protest during the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018. PT-FI is disputing the incremental 2.5 percent export duty while the matter is pending in Indonesia Tax Court proceedings, and amounts paid are being held in a restricted cash account or in a current or long-term receivable in the consolidated balance sheets ($144 million at December 31, 2018, consisting of $15 million in income and other tax receivables, $7 million in other current assets and $122 million in other assets; and $38 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of $22 million in other current assets and $16 million in other assets) that PT-FI expects to have released or refunded in full once the matter is resolved. In December 2018, the Indonesia Tax Court announced a ruling in favor of PT-FI related to $15 million of the disputed export duties, which PT-FI expects to collect in 2019. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI is subject to an export duty until smelter development reaches 50 percent , at which time the export duty will be eliminated (refer to Note 13 for export duty rates). In January 2019, PT-FI noted that the Indonesian Supreme Court posted on its website an unfavorable decision related to a PT-FI 2005 withholding tax matter. PT-FI had also received an unfavorable Indonesian Supreme Court decision in November 2017 and has other pending cases at the Indonesian Supreme Court related to withholding taxes for employees and other service providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total approximately $61 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), including penalties and interest. As a result of the January 2019 ruling, PT-FI concluded a loss on all outstanding withholding tax matters is probable under applicable accounting guidance, and it recorded a charge of $61 million in 2018. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $528 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily for environmental and asset retirement obligations, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $342 million at December 31, 2018 , primarily associated with environmental and asset retirement obligations. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2018 , FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $60 million , which consisted of a current portion of $11 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $49 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $15 million (a current portion of $2 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $13 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers. FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in the GOM. 157 NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Operating Leases. FCX leases various types of properties, including offices and equipment. Future minimum rentals under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2018 , total $53 million in 2019 , $42 million in 2020 , $38 million in 2021 , $32 million in 2022 , $29 million in 2023 and $171 million thereafter. Minimum payments under operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals, which are minimal. Total aggregate rental expense under operating leases was $80 million in 2018 , $59 million in 2017 and $71 million 2016 . Contractual Obligations. At December 31, 2018 , based on applicable prices on that date, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations of $2.9 billion , primarily comprising the procurement of copper concentrate ($1.5 billion), cobalt ($0.5 billion), electricity ($0.4 billion) and transportation services ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based prices. Obligations for cobalt hydroxide intermediate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt at market-based prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for South America contracted ocean freight. FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total $2.1 billion in 2019 , $234 million in 2020 , $147 million in 2021 , $50 million in 2022 , $44 million in 2023 and $301 million thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. Special Mining License (IUPK) - Indonesia. As discussed in Note 2, on December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Indonesian government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesian government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesian government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, a 10 percent profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4 percent for copper, 3.75 percent for gold and 3.25 percent for silver. PT-FI’s royalties totaled $238 million in 2018, $173 million in 2017 and $131 million in 2016. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay export duties of 5 percent , declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter progress exceeds 50 percent . PT-FI had previously agreed to and has been paying export duties since July 2014 (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of disputed export duties for the period April 2017 to December 21, 2018). PT-FI’s export duties charged against revenues totaled $180 million in 2018, $115 million in 2017 and $95 million in 2016. The IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay surface water taxes of $15 million annually, beginning in 2019. In connection with a memorandum of understanding previously entered into with the Indonesian government in July 2014, PT-FI provided an assurance bond at that time to support its commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia ($126 million based on exchange rate as of December 31, 2018). PT-FI has applied for a one-year extension of its export license, which currently expires on February 16, 2019. 158 Other. In 2016, FCX negotiated the termination and settlement of FM O&G’s drilling rig contracts with Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (Noble) and Rowan Companies plc (Rowan). Under the settlement with Noble, FCX issued 48.1 million shares of its common stock (representing a value of $540 million) during second-quarter 2016, and Noble immediately sold these shares. Under the settlement with Rowan, FCX paid $215 million in cash during 2016. FCX also agreed to provide contingent payments of up to $75 million to Noble and up to $30 million to Rowan, depending on the average price of crude oil over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. In January 2017, FCX paid $6 million to early settle a portion of the Rowan contingent payments and no additional payments were due when the contingency period ended on June 30, 2017. As a result of the settlements, FM O&G was released from a total of $1.1 billion in payment obligations under its three drilling rig contracts. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide its practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs. In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through which PT-FI has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education, economic development and local infrastructure of the area. PT-FI has committed through June 30, 2019, to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the Partnership Fund. PT-FI charged $55 million in 2018 , $44 million in 2017 and $33 million in 2016 to cost of sales for this commitment. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. As a result of the acquisition of the oil and gas business in 2013, FCX assumed a variety of crude oil and natural gas commodity derivatives to hedge the exposure to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, all of which had matured by December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , FCX had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production. A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows. 159 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the three years ended December 31, 2018 , resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2018 , FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 68 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.77 per pound, with maturities through June 2020 . A summary of (losses) gains recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including the unrealized gains (losses) on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows:

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the LMBA gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded to revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX prices, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded derivatives at December 31, 2018 , follows:

============================================================

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Contracts. FCX had no outstanding crude oil or natural gas derivative contracts as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. As part of the terms of the agreement to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties, FM O&G entered into derivative contracts during October 2016. Sentinel assumed these contracts at the time of the sale in December 2016. These derivative contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and were recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues (oil contracts) and production costs (natural gas contracts). 160 Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in cost of sales. At December 31, 2018 , Atlantic Copper held net copper forward sales contracts for 8 million pounds at an average contract price of $2.76 per pound, with maturities through February 2019 .

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by contract on its balance sheet. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchase contracts are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances. 161 A summary of these unsettled commodity contracts that are offset in the balance sheet follows:

============================================================

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of December 31, 2018 , the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $16 million . Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2018 , and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017), restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt). In addition, as of December 31, 2018 , FCX has contingent consideration assets related to certain 2016 asset sales (refer to Note 15 for the related fair value and to Note 2 for further discussion of these instruments). Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

162 NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 3 for 2018 . FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments (including those measured at NAV as a practical expedient), other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and dividends payable (refer to Note 14) follows:

164 Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted LBMA gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional cobalt purchases are valued using quoted monthly LME cobalt forward prices or average published Metals Bulletin cobalt prices, subject to certain adjustments as specified by the terms of the contracts, at each reporting date based on the month of maturity. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. The fair value of contingent consideration for the sales of TFHL and onshore California oil and gas properties (refer to Note 2 for further discussion) is calculated based on average commodity price forecasts through applicable maturity dates using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The models use various observable inputs, including Brent crude oil forward prices, historical copper and cobalt prices, volatilities, discount rates and settlement terms. As a result, these contingent consideration assets are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of contingent consideration for the sale of Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (refer to Note 2 for further discussion) is calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2018 . 165 A summary of the changes in the fair value of FCX ’ s Level 3 instrument, contingent consideration for the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties, for the years ended December 31 follows:

Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled 12 percent of FCX’s consolidated revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2018 . Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations totaling $1.2 billion in 2018 , $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016 , and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $2.2 billion in 2018 , $2.0 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016 . Labor Matters . As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 37 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 21 percent was covered by agreements that expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire within one year. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other divisions, including Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly owned smelter and refinery in Spain) and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned smelter and refinery in Indonesia), until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. 167 FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following Financial Information by Business Segment reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced 49 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2018 . South America Mining. South America mining includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro Verde mine produced 84 percent of FCX’s South America copper during 2018 . Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper products facility, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2018 , Atlantic Copper purchased 14 percent of its concentrate requirements from the North America copper mines, 5 percent from the South America mining operations and 4 percent from the Indonesia mining operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining and eliminations, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items. Other mining and eliminations include the Miami smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), Freeport Cobalt, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) and other mining support entities. 168 Financial Information by Business Segment

NOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated as of December 31, 2018 , in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2018 , were determined using $2.50 per pound for copper in North America and South America and $2.00 per pound for copper in Indonesia, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. Reserves for Indonesia would not significantly change if assessed under a long-term price of $2.50 per pound of copper as PT-FI’s reserve plan is mill-constrained by the term of its IUPK, which contains rights to extend mining rights through 2041. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , LME copper settlement prices averaged $2.65 per pound, LBMA gold prices averaged $1,259 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week averaged $8.85 per pound. 178 The recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

181 Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Information. The following information summarizes the net proved reserves of oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs)), and natural gas and the standardized measure as described below for the year ended December 31, 2016. All of FCX’s oil and natural gas reserves are located in the U.S. Management believes the reserve estimates presented herein are reasonable and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC as prescribed in Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. However, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond FCX’s control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because all oil and natural gas reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures, and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data. Therefore, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (Standardized Measure) shown below represents estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated reserves attributable to FCX’s oil and gas properties. In this regard, the information set forth in the following tables includes revisions of reserve estimates attributable to proved properties acquired in the 2013 oil and gas acquisitions, and reflects additional information from subsequent development activities, production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices. Estimated Quantities of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. The following table sets forth certain data pertaining to proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, all of which are in the U.S., for the year ended December 31, 2016 .

The average realized sales prices used in FCX’s reserve reports as of December 31, 2016 , were $34.26 per barrel of crude oil and $2.40 per one thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , FCX sold reserves in-place totaling 187 MMBOE, primarily representing all of its Deepwater GOM, onshore California and Haynesville properties. 182 Standardized Measure. The Standardized Measure (discounted at 10 percent) from production of proved oil and natural gas reserves has been developed in accordance with SEC guidelines. FCX estimated the quantity of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future periods in which they were expected to be produced based on year-end economic conditions. Estimates of future net revenues from FCX’s proved oil and gas properties and the present value thereof were made using the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials, which were held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations (excluding the impact of crude oil derivative contracts). Future gross revenues were reduced by estimated future operating costs (including production and ad valorem taxes) and future development and abandonment costs, all of which were based on current costs in effect at December 31, 2016 , and held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties. Future income taxes were calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre-tax future net cash flows, net of the tax basis of the respective oil and gas properties and utilization of FCX’s available tax carryforwards related to its oil and gas operations. The Standardized Measure related to proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016, follows:
