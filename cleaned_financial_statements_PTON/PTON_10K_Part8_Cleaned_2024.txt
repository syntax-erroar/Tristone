============================================================

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss , stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 22, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Tread+ Product Recall Return Reserve and Accrual for Estimated Repair Costs Description of the Matter As described in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company announced on May 5, 2021 a voluntary recall of its Tread+ product. The return reserve related to the impacts of the Tread+ recall of $6.7 million was included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024. The accrual for estimated costs associated with the Tread+ repair of $4.1 million was included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024. Auditing management’s estimates of the return reserve and cost accrual related to the Tread+ product recall was especially challenging due to the estimation in determining the expected rate of returns and number of requests for the Tread+ repair, both of which can fluctuate based on factors such as customer response to the relaunch of the remediated product, customer acceptance of the Tread+ repair and other market conditions with uncertain future outcomes. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls for estimating the return reserve and cost accrual. For example, we tested management’s review controls over the estimation processes to calculate the return reserve and cost accrual and the development of the underlying assumptions utilized. To test the return reserve and cost accrual, our audit procedures included, among others, validating that the Company’s estimation methodology agrees with the terms and conditions of the announced Tread+ recall and examining the Company’s key assumptions and judgements. We also performed a sensitivity analysis on each key assumption to evaluate the effect of changes on the estimated amounts, evaluated the relevance and reliability of data used in the calculations, and recalculated the estimated return reserve and the cost accrual based on the Company’s methodology.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017. New York, New York August 22, 2024 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Peloton Interactive, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to controls around the existence, completeness and valuation of inventory. Management has also identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to Precor’s business process control environment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated August 22, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York August 22, 2024 PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

See accompanying notes to these consolidated financial statements. PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in millions, except share and per share amounts) 1.

(“Peloton” or the “Company”) is a leading global fitness company with a highly engaged community of Members, which the Company defines as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a paid Peloton App Subscription, and completes 1 or more workouts in the trailing 12 month period. The Company is a category innovator at the nexus of fitness, technology, and media, with a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines innovative hardware, distinctive software, and exclusive content. Its world-renowned Instructors coach and motivate Members to be the best version of themselves anytime, anywhere.

Access to the Peloton App is available with an All-Access or Guide Membership for Members who have Connected Fitness Products or through a standalone App Membership with multiple Membership tiers. The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from recurring Subscription revenue and the sale of its Connected Fitness Products. The Company defines a “Paid Connected Fitness Subscription” as a person, household, or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building, who has paid for a subscription to a Connected Fitness Product (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers). Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peloton Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included elsewhere in these financial statements have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them. Except as described elsewhere in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the section titled “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,” there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the Form 10-K. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all cash and short-term investments purchased with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in money market and operating accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes its cash and cash equivalents are not subject to any significant credit risk. Restricted Cash The Company’s Restricted cash primarily relates to cash used to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances The Company's accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from third-party and commercial sales and amounts due from third-party payment processors. The allowance for credit losses is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation and any other forward-looking data regarding customers' ability to pay which may be available. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3, Revenue for additional information. Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods, work-in-process and raw materials. Finished goods are primarily purchased from contract manufacturers. Connected Fitness Product, accessories, apparel, and raw material inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weighted-average cost basis. The Company periodically assesses and adjusts the value of inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. Spare parts are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of revenue as consumed. Refer to Note 6, Inventories for additional information. Property and Equipment Property and equipment purchased by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For leasehold improvements, the useful life is the lesser of the applicable lease term or the expected asset life. Charges for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 8, Property and Equipment for additional information. Internal-Use Software The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and website development to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities including maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years . Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Business Combination To determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or business combinations, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets will not represent a business. To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. If the transaction is deemed to be a business combination, any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions for additional information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired developed technology and other finite-lived intangible assets. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are recognized at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Convertible Senior Notes In February 2021, the Company issued in a private offering $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes"), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional notes, of which $801.0 million aggregate principal amount was repurchased in May 2024. In May 2024, the Company issued in a private offering $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of the option to purchase additional notes. The 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options . Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, debt with an embedded conversion feature shall accounted for in its entirety as a liability and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument shall be accounted for as attributable to the conversion feature unless the conversion feature is required to be accounted for separately as an embedded derivative or the conversion feature results in a premium that is subject to the guidance in ASC 470. The 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes (together, “the Notes”) are accounted for as a liability with no portion of the proceeds attributable to the conversion options as the conversion feature did not require separate accounting as a derivative, and the Notes did not involve a premium subject to the guidance in ASC 470. Refer to Note 12, Debt for additional information. Cost of Revenue Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue consists of our portfolio of Connected Fitness Products, related accessories, and branded apparel product costs, including third party manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement and service costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, costs related to our commercial business, depreciation of property and equipment, and certain costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Inventory write-downs and related obsolescence reserve expense are also included within Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue. Subscription Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content creation and costs to stream content to our Members. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and occupancy, other studio overhead, Instructor and production personnel-related expenses, depreciation of property and equipment as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, third-party platform streaming costs, and payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings. Music Royalty Fees The Company has entered into agreements with music rights holders for the music we include in the operation of our service. The Company pays and recognizes music royalty fees in accordance with the terms of the relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. This can include royalties incurred for paid subscriptions and royalties incurred as part of free-trial offers, which are recognized within Subscription cost of revenue and Sales and marketing in the Company’s Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, respectively. If a minimum guarantee or advance payment provision exists within a license agreement, the guarantee or advance is recorded as a prepaid asset and amortized over the shorter of the period consumed or the term of the license agreement. Given the at times migratory, uncertain, or opaque nature of music rights ownership, the Company’s archived library may continue to include music for which certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon license agreements previously entered into and the respective music rights holdings. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery of its deferred tax assets is not more-likely-than-not, a valuation allowance is established. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within income tax expense. Refer to Note 17, Income Taxes for additional information. Advertising Costs Advertising and other promotional costs to market the Company's products are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $435.0 million, $362.6 million, and $637.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included within Sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel- and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, software platform expenses, and depreciation of property and equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation In August 2019, the Company's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors") adopted the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to its ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is twenty-four months . The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at a 15 percent discount. The ESPP also includes a look-back provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date. In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ("the 2019 Plan"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For stock option and restricted stock unit grants, vesting generally occurs over four years . For performance-based awards issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock, the expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards, the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company derived its volatility from the average historical stock volatilities of several peer public companies over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the expected volatility is based on a blended average of average historical stock volatilities of several peer companies over the expected term of the stock options, historical volatility of the Company's stock price, and implied stock price volatility derived from the price of exchange traded options on the Company's stock. The Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as the Company’s historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield is 0.0 % as the Company has not paid and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its common stock. The 2019 Plan serves as the successor to the 2015 Stock Plan. The 2015 Stock Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. Generally, the 2015 Stock Plan permitted the early exercise of stock options granted prior to the IPO. The unvested portion of shares exercised was recorded within Other current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to equity as vesting occurred. Refer to Note 15, Equity-Based Compensation for additional information. Restructuring The Company's restructuring charges consist of employee severance, one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefits related to the reduction of its workforce, and other exit and disposal costs. One-time termination benefits are expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service beyond a minimum retention period, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period. Ongoing benefits are expensed when restructuring activities are probable and the benefit amounts are estimable. Liabilities for other costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value and are recognized when the liability is incurred. Other costs primarily consist of termination fees, idle rent and related expenses for exited locations, professional services, and other costs related to restructuring activities, and are expensed when incurred. Refer to Note 4, Restructuring for additional information. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan offered to all of its U.S. employees, as well as plans at certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company's matching contributions totaled $18.5 million, $19.1 million, and $26.3 million, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss. If a loss is probable and the loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: • Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities, and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company’s material financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and the convertible senior notes. The carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their fair values at June 30, 2024 and 2023, due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment. Refer to Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Earnings (Loss) Per Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s restricted stock awards and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. The Company considers any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock. These participating securities do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were not allocated to the Company’s participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, ESPP shares to be issued, and vesting of restricted stock awards. Refer to Note 18, Net Loss Per Share for additional information. Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among others, those related to revenue related reserves, product recall and corrective action cost, the realizability of inventory, fair value measurements, the incremental borrowing rate associated with lease liabilities, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, product warranty, goodwill, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, transaction price estimates, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and asset acquisitions, future restructuring charges, contingent consideration, and commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted ASU 2020-06 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity . The guidance simplified the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, thereby limiting the accounting results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amended the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, the guidance eliminated the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The Company adopted the standard effective July 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective transition method. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a reduction to Additional paid-in capital of $160.1 million to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2026 Notes (as defined in Note 12 - Debt), an increase of $119.6 million in the carrying value of its 2026 Notes to reflect the full principal amount of the 2026 Notes outstanding net of issuance costs, and a decrease to Accumulated deficit of $40.6 million. ASU 2021-08 In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The guidance requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on July 1, 2023. The standard will be applied to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date. The impact will depend on the contract assets and liabilities acquired in future business combinations. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU 2023-07 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. ASU 2023-09 In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU enhances income tax information primarily through changes in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 3. Revenue The Company’s primary sources of revenue are its recurring content Subscription revenue, and revenue from sales of its Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor branded fitness products, delivery and installation services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; • Determination of the transaction price; • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and • Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue is reported net of sales returns and concessions, discounts and allowances, incentives, and rebates to commercial distributors as a reduction of the transaction price. Certain contracts include consideration payable that is accounted for as a payment for distinct goods or services. The Company’s transaction price estimate includes our estimate for product returns and concessions based on the terms and conditions of home trial programs, historical return trends by product category, impact of seasonality, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, and current business practices, and record the expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur. For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Company generally determines the standalone selling price based on the prices charged to customers. The Company applies the practical expedient as per ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information related to remaining performance obligations due to their original expected terms being one year or less. The Company also applies the practical expedient as per ASC 340-40-25-4 and expenses sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are recorded in Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Some of the Company’s revenues relate to rental lease arrangements. The Company’s rental program allows Members to lease a Bike or Bike+ with a Peloton Rental Membership for a single monthly cost and a one-time delivery fee, and gives the Member the option to purchase the equipment outright or cancel at any time with no penalty. These lease arrangements include both lease and non-lease components. Consideration is allocated between the lease and non-lease components based on management’s best estimate of the relative standalone selling price of each component. The lease component relates to the customer’s right to use the equipment over the lease term and is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease within Connected Fitness Products revenue, while the underlying equipment subject to the lease remains within Property and equipment, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciates over the equipment’s useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the underlying equipment is reflected in Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Non-lease components primarily consist of an All-Access Membership, which is recognized within Subscription revenue. Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Products include the Company’s portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, Precor branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, rental lease agreements, extended warranty agreements, branded apparel, and commercial service contracts. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness Products revenue net of sales returns and concessions, discounts and allowances, and third-party financing program fees, when the product has been delivered to the customer, except for extended warranty revenue that is recognized over the warranty period and service revenue that is recognized over the term of the service contract. The Company allows customers to return Peloton branded Connected Fitness Products within thirty days of purchase, as stated in its return policy. The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive. The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales for Connected Fitness Products within Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Subscription The Company’s subscriptions provide access to Peloton content and its library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Company’s subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month or prepaid basis. Amounts paid for subscription fees, net of refunds are included within Deferred revenue and customer deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized ratably over the subscription term. The Company records payment processing fees for its monthly subscription charges within cost of Subscription revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Product Warranty The Company offers a standard product warranty that its Connected Fitness Products will operate under normal, non-commercial use covering the touchscreen and most original Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row, and Guide components. The Company has the obligation, at its option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical as well as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty policies and business practices. The Company’s products are manufactured by contract manufacturers and, in certain cases, the Company may have recourse to such contract manufacturers. Activity related to the Company’s accrual for its estimated future product warranty obligation was as follows:

============================================================

============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $26.4 $51.1 Provision for warranty accrual 28.0 17.7 Warranty claims (34.1) (42.4) Balance at end of period $20.3 $26.4
============================================================

The Company also offers the option for customers in some markets to purchase an extended warranty and service contract that extends or enhances the technical support, parts, and labor coverage offered as part of the base warranty included with the Connected Fitness Products for additional periods beyond the standard product warranty period. Extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period and is included in Connected Fitness Products revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company’s revenue attributable to extended warranty was $36.0 million, $40.3 million and $29.6 million, representing 1 %, 1 %, and 1 % of Total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company’s revenue disaggregated by segment, excluding sales-based taxes, is included in Note 19, Segment Information . The Company’s revenue disaggregated by geographic region was as follows:

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 (in millions) North America $2,487.0 $2,591.1 $3,259.6 International 213.5 209.1 322.5 Total revenue $2,700.5 $2,800.2 $3,582.1
============================================================

The Company’s revenue attributable to the United States was $2,389.2 million, $2,496.3 million, and $3,100.0 million, representing 88 %, 89 %, and 87 % of Total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deferred Revenue and Customer Deposits Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received for the Company’s performance obligation to transfer, or stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. Customer deposits represent payments received in advance before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer and are refundable. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, deferred revenue of $95.9 million and $92.1 million, respectively, and customer deposits of $67.7 million and $95.2 million, respectively, were included in Deferred revenue and customer deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $97.2 million and $92.4 million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 4. Restructuring In February 2022, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring plan to realign the Company’s operational focus to support its multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”). The 2022 Restructuring Plan originally included: (i) reducing the Company’s headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for the Company’s previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities; and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations. In fiscal year 2023, the Company continued to take actions to implement the 2022 Restructuring Plan. In July 2022, the Company announced it was exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding its current relationship with a Taiwanese manufacturer, Rexon Industrial Corporation. Additionally, in August 2022, the Company announced the decision to (i) fully transition its North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of its delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminate a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exit its real-estate footprints in its Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reduce its retail showroom presence. In January 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million. On April 22, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). The Company believes the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount; and (ii) continued closures of the Company’s retail locations. The Company expects the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025. As a result of these restructuring initiatives, the Company incurred the charges shown in the following table. Asset write-downs and write-offs are included within Impairment expense, and Write-offs of inventory related to restructuring activities are included within Connected Fitness Products Cost of Revenue, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The remaining charges incurred are included within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss:

(2) Includes $16.1 million and $3.1 million of exit and disposal costs and professional fees related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and 2024 Restructuring Plan, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. (3) Includes $31.1 million and $9.7 million of asset write-downs and write-offs related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and 2024 Restructuring Plan, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. (4) Includes $7.2 million and $(0.6) million of stock-based compensation expense related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and 2024 Restructuring Plan, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. (5) Includes write-offs of inventory related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan. (6) Includes loss on sale of subsidiary recognized in connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan. Due to the actions taken pursuant to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and 2024 Restructuring Plan, the Company tested certain long-lived assets (asset groups) for recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the asset group to estimates of their future undiscounted cash flows, which were generally the liquidation value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, income from a sublease arrangement. Based on the results of the recoverability tests, the Company determined that during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the undiscounted cash flows of certain assets (asset groups) were below their carrying values, indicating impairment. The assets were written down to their estimated fair values, which were determined based on their estimated liquidation or sales value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, discounted cash flows of a sublease arrangement. See further discussion in Note 8 - Property and Equipment and Note 11 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents a roll-forward of cash restructuring-related liabilities, which is included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

In connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, the Company estimates that it will incur additional cash charges of approximately $40.0 million, primarily composed of lease termination and other exit costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2025. Additionally, the Company expects to recognize additional non-cash charges of approximately $20.0 million, primarily composed of non-inventory asset impairment charges on retail showrooms in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, the majority of are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2025. 5.

_________________________ (1) Includes $0.1 million and $1.0 million of software under development as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. During fiscal 2022, 2023, and 2024, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had impairment triggering events, including (i) realignment of cost structure in connection with the restructuring initiatives, (ii) softening demand and (iii) significant decrease in the market price of certain long-lived asset groups. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain asset groups. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, primarily consisting of $14.9 million relating to exiting retail showrooms and $5.0 million related to Connected Fitness assets. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of impairment loss of $32.5 million related to capitalized software, $19.5 million related to exiting certain corporate office locations, $17.2 million relating to exiting retail showrooms, $16.5 million related to Connected Fitness assets, and $8.2 million related to other manufacturing assets. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of impairment loss of $57.6 million related to Connected Fitness assets, $21.3 million related to manufacturing equipment, $19.0 million related to Peloton Output Park and $15.9 million related to acquired technology. These impairment charges reduced the carrying value of these asset groups from $222.9 million to $109.1 million. Additionally, management identified changes to the product and enterprise technology roadmaps that indicated that certain programs no longer had expected future use. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $54.1 million related to software under development that reduced the carrying value of those assets from $61.0 million to $6.9 million. Impairment charges are included within Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of June 30, 2024, 81 % and 17 % of the Company's total Property and equipment, net was attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.

During fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized no intangible asset impairment loss. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $165.6 million, primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired developed technology, brand, distributor and customer relationships, and assembled workforce, which resulted from strategic actions taken by the Company under the 2022 Restructuring Plan. The Company determined that the estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain intangibles. The impairment loss was included in Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company recognized intangible asset amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the amount of $10.6 million, $15.8 million, and $43.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

11. Leases Lessee arrangements The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various expiration dates through 2039. The Company leases space for its corporate headquarters and the operation of its distribution facilities, warehouses, factories, showrooms, production studio facilities, and other office spaces. The Company does not have any material finance leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and records the leases in its financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are established on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for leases with an expected term greater than one year. As the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable, the Company uses its secured incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate and equipment leases. The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company's lease terms include options to extend or terminate the underlying lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The operating lease arrangements included in the measurement of lease liabilities do not reflect options to extend or terminate, as management does not consider the exercise of these options to be reasonably certain. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. The Company calculates the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, percentage of sales, common area charges, taxes paid by the landlord that are charged to the Company, and changes to the consumer price index. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. The Company subleases certain warehouses, office spaces, and showroom spaces to third parties, which does not relieve the Company of its primary lease obligations with the lessor (the “head lease”). These subleases are classified as operating leases, and therefore the Company continues to account for the head lease as it did before the commencement date of the sublease. Sublease income is presented within the same category of operating expenses as the underlying head lease expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, the Company assesses the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions of ASC 360. Total operating lease expense, net, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was as follows:

As discussed in Note 8 - Property and Equipment, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had triggering events for its long-lived assets, including the Company’s right-of-use assets. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, primarily consisting of $16.6 million related to retail showroom right-of-use assets and $7.5 million related to Connected Fitness right-of-use assets. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges of $6.4 million related to certain corporate office right-of-use assets, $5.3 million related to Connected Fitness right-of-use assets, $3.0 million related to retail showroom right-of-use assets, and $1.2 million related to other manufacturing right-of-use assets. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges of $28.5 million related to Connected Fitness right-of-use assets, which reduced the carrying value of these right-of-use assets from $161.2 million to $132.7 million. Impairment charges are included within Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Lessor arrangements As discussed in Note 3 - Revenue, the Company leases certain Connected Fitness equipment under its rental program. The lease arrangement provides the customer with an option to purchase the underlying equipment or terminate the lease at any time. The price to purchase the underlying equipment is determined based on the number of months that the customer has leased the equipment, and is not considered a bargain purchase option. All rental lease agreements are considered operating leases, and the Company currently does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases as a lessor. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized lease revenue on its rental program of $47.3 million, $19.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, within Connected Fitness Products revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 12. Debt Convertible Notes due 2029 In May 2024, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $50.0 million of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2029 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. The net proceeds from this offering of 2029 Notes were approximately $342.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions of $7.7 million. Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes is initially convertible into 218.4360 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $4.58 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Notes Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur or the Company elects to redeem the 2029 Notes, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. The 2029 Notes will mature on December 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after September 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2029 Notes Indenture. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the 2029 Notes Indenture) of the 2029 Notes, at its option, on or after June 7, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the 2029 Notes periodically. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2029 Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of fundamental change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2029 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of current or future subsidiaries of the Company (including trade payables and to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof, preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries). The effective interest rate upon issuance of the 2029 Notes was 5.97 %, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2024. The net carrying amount of the 2029 Notes was as follows:

Convertible Notes due 2026 In February 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $125.0 million of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes does not accrete. Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes is initially convertible into 4.1800 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $239.23 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2026 Notes Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur or the Company elects to redeem the 2026 Notes, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. The 2026 Notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2026 Notes Indenture. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the 2026 Notes Indenture) of the 2026 Notes, at its option, on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the 2026 Notes periodically. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2026 Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2026 Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of fundamental change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of current or future subsidiaries of the Company (including trade payables and to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof, preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries). Repurchase of a Portion of the 2026 Convertible Notes In May 2024, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2026 Notes to repurchase $801.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for an aggregate of $724.9 million of cash. The Company accounted for this repurchase of the 2026 Notes as a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50, Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments (“ASC 470-50”). The Company recorded a $69.8 million gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ending June 30, 2024, which includes the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million, which is included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

____________________________ (1) The decreases in total interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were due to the derecognition of the unamortized debt discount, partially offset by the increases in the amortization of issuance costs previously recognized in equity. These changes were the result of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2020-06, as of July 1, 2022, as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Termination of Capped Call Transactions In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). In the last quarter of its fiscal year ending 2024, the Company terminated the Capped Call Transactions in their entirety pursuant to negotiated termination agreements with each such counterparty. Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain banks and financial institutions party thereto as lenders and issuing banks. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), which will be due and payable on May 30, 2029. The Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 0.25 %, payable at the end of each fiscal quarter and on the maturity date. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which will mature on May 30, 2029. The Company is only required to meet the total liquidity covenant, set at $250.0 million for the last business day of any week, and the subscription revenues covenant, set at $1.2 billion for the four-quarter trailing period, to the extent any revolving loans are borrowed and outstanding. The Revolving Facility, when drawn, bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 4.00 % per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 5.00 % per annum. The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.50 % per annum on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility, provided that the commitment fee is subject to one 0.125 % step-down after the delivery of the financial statements and related compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending on or after September 30, 2024 for which the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is less than 5.00 to 1.00. The Term Loan initially bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 5.00 % per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 6.00 % per annum. After the delivery of the financial statements and related compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending on or after September 30, 2024 for which the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is less than 5.00 to 1.00, the applicable rate for Alternate Base Rate loans or Term SOFR Rate loans will be subject to one 0.50 % step-down. Any borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate is subject to a 1.00 % floor and the Term SOFR Rate is subject to a 0.00 % floor. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens or grant negative pledges, make loans and investments, conduct certain transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets, enter into certain swap agreements, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. Certain baskets and covenant levels have been adjusted and will apply equally to both the Term Loan and Revolving Facility for so long as the Term Loan is outstanding. The obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets, with certain exceptions set forth in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and are required to be guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company if, at the end of future financial quarters, certain conditions are not met. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company incurred total commitment fees of $1.3 million, $1.6 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, which are included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had drawn the full amount of the Term Loan and had not drawn on the Revolving Facility, and the Company had $1,000.0 million total outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Term Loan was accounted for as a modification, extinguishment, or new loan for certain lenders in accordance with ASC 470-50. Accordingly, incremental discount and debt issuance costs of $10.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, will be amortized to Interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the Company expensed $8.7 million of debt issuance costs incurred with third parties related to loss on debt modification and recognized a $7.5 million loss on extinguishment related to previously deferred debt discount and debt issuance costs, which are included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had not drawn any amount under the Revolving Facility and as such did not have to test the financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of cash and cash equivalents as collateral for standby letters of credit. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $53.2 million, which are classified as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon entering into the Term Loan, the effective interest rate was 12.4 %, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2024. The net carrying amount of the Term Loan was as follows:

Tread+ and Tread Product Recall Return Reserves and Cost Estimates On May 5, 2021, the Company announced a voluntary recall of its Tread+ in collaboration with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (" CPSC") and halted sales of this product to work on product enhancements . On May 18, 2023, the Company and the CPSC jointly announced the approval of a rear guard repair for the recalled Tread+. The Company has made this rear guard available to its Members who continue to own a Tread+ and, during the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company resumed deliveries of the Tread+ from its existing inventory with the rear guard installed. The following table details the (benefit)/reduction to Connected Fitness Products revenue for actual and future returns and costs associated with Tread+ and Tread product recalls that were recorded in Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue.

============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 (in millions) Returns accrual for (benefit)/reduction to Connected Fitness Products revenue $(4.5) $14.6 $48.9 (Benefits) costs of product recalls $(4.0) $15.7 $8.1
============================================================

Return reserves related to the impacts of the Tread+ recall of $6.7 million and $24.4 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively . Accruals for costs associated with the Tread+ repair of $4.1 million and $10.0 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 , respectively . The estimated return reserves are based on historical and expected product returns. The estimated costs associated with the Tread+ repair are primarily based on the estimated number of requests for the Tread+ repair and the estimated costs of the production, delivery, and installation of the remedy. Bike Seat Post Recall On May 11, 2023, in collaboration with the CPSC, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the original Peloton Bike (not Bike+) sold in the U.S. from January 2018 to May 2023 related to its seat post, and the Company is offering Members a free replacement seat post as the approved repair. As a result of this recall, the Company recognized $(5.5) million and $48.4 million for the (benefits) costs to replace the bike seat posts based on an amount that was deemed probable and reasonably estimable, reflected in Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. As o f June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 , accruals of $1.2 million and $42.2 million, respectively, were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the recall. The estimated cost to replace the bike seat posts is primarily based on the estimated number of requests for seat posts and the estimated costs of the production and shipment of the replacement parts. For more detail on the potential impacts of the recall to the Company’s business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members—Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects or product safety issues, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation.” Commitments to Suppliers The Company utilizes contract manufacturers to build its products and accessories. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information the Company supplies, which typically covers a rolling 12-month period. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires inventories from such manufacturers through blanket purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information and availability of goods. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods that range a number of months. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and/or adjust its requirements based on its business needs for a period of time before the order is due to be fulfilled. While the Company’s purchase orders are legally cancellable in many situations, there are some which are not cancellable in the event of a demand plan change or other circumstances, such as where the supplier has procured unique, Peloton-specific designs, and/or specific non-cancellable, non-returnable components based on the Company’s provided forecasts. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s commitments to contract with third-party manufacturers for their inventory on-hand and component purchase commitments related to the manufacture of Peloton products were estimated to be approximately $87.8 million, of which $80.1 million is expected to be paid over the next twelve months. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings The Company is, or may become, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters set forth below. We deny the allegations in the active matters described below and intend to vigorously defend against such matters. Some of the Company’s legal and regulatory proceedings, including matters and litigation that center around intellectual property claims, may be based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except for proceedings that have settled or been terminated, or except where otherwise indicated below, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages for such matters, and therefore, the Company has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability, and, if the liability is material, discloses the amount of the liability reserved. Unless otherwise disclosed below, while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred, the Company is unable to estimate a range of potential loss due to the complexity and current status of these lawsuits. In these matters, the Company has not established a reserve. The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to the Company’s accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters the Company discloses that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial. Given that the Company’s legal and regulatory proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In May 2021, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of our Tread+ product in collaboration with the CPSC. In December 2022, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the CPSC regarding matters related to the Tread+ recall. In the settlement, the Company agreed to pay a $19.1 million civil penalty, resolving the CPSC’s charges that we violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”). On May 18, 2023, the Company and the CPSC jointly announced the approval of a rear guard repair for the recalled Tread+. The SEC is investigating the Company’s public disclosures concerning the Tread+ recall, as well as other matters. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Department of Homeland Security subpoenaed the Company for documents and other information related to the Company’s statutory obligations, including under the CPSA. In addition to such investigations, the Company is presently subject to personal injury claims related to the safety of the Tread+. On November 16, 2021, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York consolidated two putative securities class action lawsuits against the Company and certain of the Company’s officers under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 21-cv-02369-CBA-PK (“EDNY Class Action”), and appointed Richard Neswick as lead plaintiff. On January 21, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint in the action purportedly on behalf of a class consisting of those individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s common stock between September 11, 2020 and May 5, 2021. Lead plaintiff alleged that the Company and certain of the Company’s officers made false or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), regarding the Peloton Tread+ and the safety of the product. On April 17, 2023, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the action for $14.0 million, for which the Company had previously taken a reserve. Under the terms of this agreement, defendants continue to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On July 9, 2024, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the EDNY Class Action. On October 26, 2021 and January 24, 2022, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York consolidated four stockholder derivative actions purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Master File No. 21-cv-02862-CBA-PK (the “EDNY Derivative Action”), which alleged, among other claims, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. Alan Chu, Moshe Genack, Xingqi Liu and Anthony Franchi were appointed as co-lead plaintiffs. The EDNY Derivative Action was stayed on February 11, 2022, and that stay was continued on March 8, 2023 pending resolution of the EDNY Class Action. On December 14, 2022, two putative verified stockholder derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors asserting similar allegations to those made in the EDNY Derivative Action, were consolidated as In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, Consol. Case No. 2022-1051-KSJM (the “Chancery Derivative Action”). The Chancery Derivative Action was stayed pending resolution of the EDNY Class Action. On December 22, 2022, a stockholder filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting similar allegations to those in the EDNY Derivative Action and the Chancery Derivative Action against certain of the Company’s officers and directors, captioned Blackburn v. Foley, et al., Case No. 22-cv-01618-GBW (the “Blackburn Action”), which was also stayed on January 12, 2023 pending resolution of the EDNY Class Action. On July 29, 2024, the parties in the EDNY Derivative Action, the Chancery Derivative Action, and the Blackburn Action agreed to a settlement-in-principle to resolve those derivative actions. On May 11, 2023, in collaboration with the CPSC, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the original Peloton Bike (not Bike+) sold in the U.S. from January 2018 to May 2023 related to its seat post, and the Company is offering a free replacement seat post as the approved repair. On June 9, 2023, Sam Solomon filed a putative securities class action against the Company and certain of the Company’s officers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Case No. 1:23-cv-04279-MKB-JRC (the “2023 Securities Litigation”). Jia Tian and David Feigelman were appointed as co-lead plaintiffs. On November 6, 2023, co-lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint purportedly on behalf of a class consisting of those individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between May 6, 2021 and August 22, 2023, alleging that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements relating to the seat post recall in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On February 2, 2024, defendants served a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the 2023 Securities Litigation was completed on May 17, 2024. On September 27, 2023, Courtney Cooper and Abdo P. Faissal filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors, captioned Cooper v. Boone, et. al., Case No. 23-cv-07193-MKB-MMH, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act for any liability the Company may incur as a result of the 2023 Securities Litigation. On January 8, 2024, the court stayed the action pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the 2023 Securities Litigation. On May 5, 2022, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York consolidated two putative securities class action lawsuits against the Company and certain of the Company’s officers under the caption City of Hialeah Employees Retirement System et al. v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., et al., Case No. 21-CV-09582-ALC-OTW and appointed Robeco Capital Growth Funds SICAV – Robeco Global Consumer Trends as lead plaintiff in the class action (the “SDNY Class Action”). Lead plaintiff filed its amended complaint on June 25, 2022, alleging that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements about demand for the Company’s products and the reasons for the Company’s inventory growth, and engaged in improper trading in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act. On March 30, 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss, with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 6, 2023, purportedly on behalf of a class consisting of those individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between February 5, 2021 and January 19, 2022, and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on June 16, 2023. Briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the SDNY Class Action was completed on August 18, 2023. On July 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware consolidated three stockholder derivative actions purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. 2023 Derivative Litigation, Consol. Case No. 2023-0224-KSJM, which alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by purportedly making false statements about demand for the Company’s products and engaging in improper trading. Allison Manzella, Clark Ovruchesky, Daniel Banks and Karen Florentino are co-lead plaintiffs. The court stayed the action on September 26, 2023 pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the SDNY Class Action. On August 4, 2022, Mayville Engineering Company, Inc. (“MEC”) filed suit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Index No. 652735/2022, alleging claims for breach of contract, or, in the alternative, breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. MEC alleges that the Company breached a supply agreement under which MEC agreed to supply certain parts for Peloton products, and that it is entitled to damages in an amount exceeding $107.0 million, plus pre-judgment interest, fees, and costs. On January 6, 2023, the court partially granted and partially denied the Company’s motion to dismiss MEC’s complaint, dismissing MEC’s alternative claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing with prejudice, but allowing MEC’s claim for breach of contract to move forward. On April 11, 2024, the court’s decision on the motion to dismiss was upheld on appeal, and the appellate Court simultaneously ruled in the Company’s favor on a separate appeal of a discovery order. In September 2023, the Company asserted a counterclaim and affirmative defense against MEC for fraudulent inducement of the supply agreement. Discovery is ongoing with a current fact discovery deadline of October 4, 2024. No trial date has been set. The Company cannot estimate the precise amount of any reasonably possible loss, as the estimate would depend on numerous uncertainties including future legal rulings, further factual developments concerning the extent of any recoverable damages, and the success of its counterclaim. The range of reasonably possible loss runs from zero to the full amount of MEC’s claim described above. 14. Stockholders' Equity On November 16, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as representatives of the several underwriters named therein relating to the offer and sale by the Company (the “Offering”) of 27,173,912 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s Class A common stock, which includes 3,260,869 shares of Class A common stock issued and sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. The Company sold the Shares to the underwriters at the public offering price of $46.00 per share less underwriting discounts . The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $1.2 billion after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s offering expenses. 15. Equity-Based Compensation 2019 Equity Incentive Plan In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Plan, which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. The 2019 Plan serves as the successor to the 2015 Stock Plan (the "2015 Plan"). The 2015 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. Any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2015 Plan on the effective date of the 2019 Plan became available for grant under the 2019 Plan and will be issued as Class A common stock. Under the terms of the 2019 Plan, for stock option and restricted stock unit grants, vesting generally occurs over four years . Stock option grants are not exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant or such shorter period as specified in a stock award agreement. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock equal to 5 % of the total outstanding shares of all of the Company’s classes of common stock as of each June 30 immediately preceding the date of increase (the “evergreen feature”), or a lesser amount as determined by the Board of Directors. On July 1, 2023, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan was automatically increased according to its terms by 17,838,381 shares. In October 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the 2019 Plan (the “Amendment”) that increases the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan by 36,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (and retains the existing evergreen feature through July 1, 2029) and extends the right to grant awards under the 2019 Plan through October 24, 2033. The Amendment became effective following approval by the Company’s stockholders on December 7, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, 63,750,706 shares of Class A common stock were available for future award under the 2019 Plan. Stock Options The following summary sets forth the stock option activity under the 2019 Plan:

============================================================

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and vested and exercisable, were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock as of June 30, 2024. The fair value of the common stock is the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $12.7 million, $85.1 million, and $376.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. On July 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-time repricing of certain stock option awards that had been granted to date under the 2019 Plan. The repricing impacted stock options held by all employees who remained employed through July 25, 2022. The repricing did not apply to the Company’s U.S.-based hourly employees (or employees with equivalent roles in non-U.S. locations) or its C-level executives. The original exercise prices of the repriced stock options ranged from $12.94 to $146.79 per share for the 2,138 total grantees. Each stock option was repriced to have a per share exercise price of $9.13 , which was the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on July 1, 2022. There were no changes to the number of shares, the vesting schedule or the expiration date of the repriced stock options. Incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the repricing was $21.9 million in the aggregate. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the weighted-average grant date fair value per option was $2.46 , $6.42 , and $22.27 , respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes method with the following assumptions:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted, and in September 2019, the Company's stockholders approved, the ESPP, through which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at a discount through accumulated payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on September 25, 2019, the date the registration statement, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, was declared effective by the SEC (the "Effective Date"). The number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock that will be available for issuance and sale to eligible employees under the ESPP will increase automatically on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company beginning on July 1, 2020 through 2029, in an amount equal to 1 % of the total number of outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's common stock on the immediately preceding June 30, or such lesser number as may be determined by the Board of Directors or applicable committee in its sole discretion. On July 1, 2023, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was automatically increased according to its terms by 3,567,676 shares. As of June 30, 2024, a total of 15,245,417 shares of Class A common stock were available for sale to employees under the ESPP. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each offering period will consist of four six-month purchase periods, provided that the initial offering period commenced on the Effective Date and ended on August 31, 2021, and the initial purchase period ended February 28, 2020. Thereafter, each offering period and each purchase period commences on September 1 and March 1 and ends on August 31 and February 28 of each two-year period or each six-month period, respectively, subject to a reset provision. If the closing stock price on the first day of an offering period is higher than the closing stock price on the last day of any applicable purchase period, participants will be withdrawn from the ongoing offering period immediately following the purchase of ESPP shares on the purchase date and would automatically be enrolled in the subsequent offering period (“ESPP reset”), resulting in a modification under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation . Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the purchase price for each share of Class A common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value per share on the first trading day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share on the last trading day of the applicable purchase period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of shares estimated to be purchased at the commencement of the ESPP offering periods were as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 Weighted average risk-free interest rate 2.1 % 0.9 % 0.6 % Weighted average expected term (in years) 1.3 1.3 1.2 Weighted average expected volatility 93.0 % 88.2 % 70.7 % Expected dividend yield — — —
============================================================

The expected term assumptions were based on each offering period's respective purchase date. The expected volatility was derived from the blended average of historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies that the Company considers to be comparable to its business over a period equivalent to the expected terms of the stock options and the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. Beginning in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. The risk-free rate assumptions were based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grants. The dividend yield assumption was zero as the Company has not historically paid any dividends and does not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded Stock-based compensation expense associated with the ESPP of $7.6 million, $17.3 million, and $13.0 million respectively. In connection with the offering period that ended on August 31, 2023, employees purchased 373,114 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted-average price of $5.42 under the ESPP. In connection with the offering period that ended on February 28, 2024, employees purchased under the ESPP 575,897 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted-average price of $3.94 . As of June 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP was $8.0 million, which will be amortized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.7 years. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The Company's total stock-based compensation expense was as follows:

============================================================

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $470.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, 13 employees of the Company who were eligible to participate in the Company’s Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Severance Plan”) terminated their employment. Certain modifications were made to equity awards, including, in certain instances, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 90 days to one year (or the option expiration date, if earlier), and extended vesting was tied to certain consulting services that were deemed to be non-substantive. In one instance, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 90 days to approximately 2.8 years. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $49.6 million within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, certain modifications were made to equity awards for four employees, who were eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, excluding the impact separately disclosed below, of our former President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who was also covered under the Severance Plan. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, this included the extension of the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options from 90 days to one year (or the option expiration date, if earlier). In one instances during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 90 days to the earlier of the original expiration date or 3 years. This employee transitioned to a non-executive advisory role. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. On February 7, 2022, the Board of Directors granted our former President and CEO, 8,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the "Option Award"). The Option Award had an exercise price of $38.77 per share, equal to the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on the CEO Commencement Date of February 9, 2022. The awards were to vest and become exercisable over four years , with 1/48th vesting on each monthly anniversary of the CEO Commencement Date, subject to the provision of the CEO’s continued service to the Company through each vesting date. The awards were to be exercisable through February 8, 2032. On May 2, 2024, Mr. McCarthy transitioned to a non-executive, strategic advisory role and was granted a new option award (the "Advisory Award") that will vest in equal monthly installments through December 31, 2024. Mr. McCarthy also received one year of accelerated vesting on all outstanding stock options (other than the Advisory Award), which will remain exercisable until December 31, 2027. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, in connection with the CEO transition, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $41.9 million for the one year of accelerated vesting of the Option Award, which had an exercise price of $38.77 per share and a grant date fair value of approximately $167.6 million. In addition, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $5.4 million for the modification of stock option awards related to the extension of the exercise window through December 31, 2027. These expenses were recognized within General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 16. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Vendors Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no customers representing greater than 10% of the Company’s Total revenue. The Company's top two vendors accounted for approximately 86 % of inventory purchased the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s top three vendors accounted for approximately 78 % of inventory purchased and the Company’s top two vendors accounted for approximately 60 % of inventory purchased, respectively. The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the Company’s products require one or more components that are available from only a single source. 17. Income Taxes The components of loss before income taxes are as follows:

A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:

============================================================

The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 are due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation, and state and international taxes. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits, and state and international taxes. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits, and state and international taxes. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% minimum tax rate applied to corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and also includes an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock. The Company has reviewed the provisions of the law and does not believe that any of the provisions will have a material impact on the business. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan was enacted, which extends the period companies can claim an Employee Retention Credit, expands the IRC Section 162(m) limit on deductions for publicly traded companies, and repeals the election that allows US affiliate groups to allocate interest expense on a worldwide basis, among other provisions. The Company reviewed the provisions of the law and determined it had no material impact for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”), non-qualified stock options, accruals and reserves, lease liability, research and development tax credits, §263A UNICAP, and Section 174 capitalized expenditures. A valuation allowance was maintained and/or established in substantially all jurisdictions on the Company’s gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2024 and 2023. As of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company continued to maintain that it is not at the more likely than not standard, wherein deferred taxes will be realized due to the recent history of losses and management’s expectation of continued tax losses. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

============================================================

============================================================

As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal NOLs of approximately $3,313.8 million and $3,101.6 million, respectively, of which $64.8 million will begin to expire in 2034 and the remainder will be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone three ownership changes in the past which have historically subjected its NOLs to a Section 382 limitation. The resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section 382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022, therefore no NOLs are currently limited. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had state NOLs of approximately $2,590.8 million and $2,309.9 million, respectively, which began to expire at various dates beginning in 2024 if not utilized. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had foreign NOLs of approximately $711.3 million and $609.7 million, respectively, generated primarily from its operations in the United Kingdom, which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $74.6 million and $71.9 million, respectively, of federal U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2036. As of June 30, 2024, the Company did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognize and measure unrecognized tax benefits. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within Income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). At both June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits included as a component of income taxes payable within accrued expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits:

============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Beginning balance $— $— Gross (decrease) increase in unrecognized tax positions $— $— Ending balance $— $—
============================================================

Although it is possible that unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, as well as foreign jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Accordingly, on a continuing basis, the Company cooperates with taxing authorities for the various jurisdictions in which it conducts business to comply with audits and inquiries for tax periods that are open to examination. The tax years ended June 30, 2021 and later remain open to examination by tax authorities in the United States and United Kingdom. 18. Net Loss Per Share The computation of loss per share is as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 ($in millions, except per share amounts) Basic and diluted loss per share: Net loss attributable to common stockholders $(551.9) $(1,261.7) $(2,827.7) Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 365,546,334 346,670,699 322,368,818 Basic and diluted loss per share $(1.51) $(3.64) $(8.77)
============================================================

Basic and diluted loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. The following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect would have been anti-dilutive:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 Employee stock options 7,271,719 13,742,253 36,846,242 Restricted stock units and awards 817,182 1,408,482 174,580 Shares estimated to be purchased under ESPP — — 28,370
============================================================

Impact of the Notes The conversion option will have a dilutive impact on net income per share of common stock when the average market price per share of the Company's Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the 2026 Notes of $239.23 per share and the 2029 Notes of $4.58 per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the weighted average price per share of the Company's Class A common stock was below the conversion price of the Notes. The denominator for basic and diluted loss per share does not include any effect from the Capped Call Transactions the Company entered into concurrently with the issuance of the 2026 Notes as this effect would be anti-dilutive. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Capped Call Transactions were terminated. Refer to Note 12, Debt for additional information. 19. Segment Information The Company applies ASC 280, Segment Reporting , in determining reportable segments. The Company has two reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products and Subscription. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the chief operating decision makers ("CODM"), the Interim Co-Chief Executive Officers, review the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for both of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segment. The Connected Fitness Products segment derives revenue from sale of the Company's portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, rental lease arrangements, extended warranty agreements, branded apparel, and commercial service contracts. The Subscription segment derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments. Key financial performance measures of the segments including Revenue, Cost of revenue, and Gross profit are as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022 (in millions) Connected Fitness Products: Revenue $991.7 $1,130.2 $2,187.5 Cost of revenue 943.0 1,328.8 2,433.8 Gross profit $48.8 $(198.6) $(246.3) Subscription: Revenue $1,708.7 $1,670.1 $1,394.7 Cost of revenue 551.0 547.9 450.0 Gross profit $1,157.7 $1,122.1 $944.7 Consolidated: Revenue $2,700.5 $2,800.2 $3,582.1 Cost of revenue 1,494.0 1,876.7 2,883.8 Gross profit $1,206.5 $923.5 $698.4
============================================================

Reconciliation of Gross Profit Operating expenditures, interest income and other expense, and taxes are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an entity wide group basis. The reconciliation between reportable Segment Gross Profit to consolidated loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes is as follows:
