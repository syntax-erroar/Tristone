============================================================

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss , stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 23, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Tread+ Returns Reserve Description of the Matter As described in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company announced on May 5, 2021 a voluntary recall of its Tread+ product. Return reserves related to the impacts of the Tread+ recall of $24.4 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023. Accruals for costs associated with the Tread+ repair of $10.0 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023. Auditing management’s estimate of the reserve related to the Tread+ product recall was especially challenging due to the high degree of estimation in determining the expected rate of returns or claims, which can fluctuate based on factors such as timing of relaunch of the products, customer behavior and other market conditions with uncertain future outcomes. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the process for estimating the reserve. For example, we tested management’s review control over the estimation process to calculate the returns reserve and the development of the underlying assumptions utilized. To test the reserve and cost estimates, our audit procedures included, among others, validating that the Company’s estimation methodology agrees with the terms and conditions of the announced Tread+ recall and examining the Company’s key assumptions and judgements. We also performed sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions to evaluate the effect of such changes on the estimated reserve, validated the reliability of data used in the calculation, and recalculated the estimated reserve balance based on the Company’s methodology.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017. New York, New York August 23, 2023 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Peloton Interactive, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in the Company’s inventory process. Management has also identified a material weakness associated with ineffective user access controls over an information technology system that supports the Company’s financial reporting process. Consequently, automated and manual business process controls that rely upon information from the affected system were also deemed ineffective. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated August 23, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York August 23, 2023 PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

See accompanying notes to these consolidated financial statements. PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in millions, except share and per share amounts) 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Description and Organization Peloton Interactive, Inc. (“Peloton” or the “Company”) is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of Members, which we define as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a paid Peloton App Membership. The Company pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness with the creation of its interactive fitness equipment (“Connected Fitness Products”) and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to its Members anytime, anywhere. The Company makes fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient while fostering social connections that encourage Members to be the best versions of themselves. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peloton Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included elsewhere in these financial statements have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them. Certain immaterial amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with current-year presentation. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all cash and short-term investments purchased with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in money market and operating accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes its cash and cash equivalents are not subject to any significant credit risk. Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserve accounts related to operating lease obligations. Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances The Company's accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from third-party sales payment processors. The allowance is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation and any other forward-looking data regarding customers' ability to pay which may be available. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3, Revenue for additional information. Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods, work-in-process and raw materials. Finished goods are purchased from contract manufacturers. Connected Fitness Product, accessories, apparel, and raw material inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weighted-average cost basis. The Company assesses the valuation of inventory and periodically adjusts the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. Spare parts are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of revenue as consumed. Refer to Note 6, Inventories for additional information. Property and Equipment Property and equipment purchased by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For leasehold improvements, the useful life is the lesser of the applicable lease term or the expected asset life. Charges for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 8, Property and Equipment for additional information. Internal-Use Software The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and website development to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities including maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years . Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Business Combination To determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or business combinations, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets will not represent a business. To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. If the transaction is deemed to be a business combination, any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions for additional information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired developed technology and other finite-lived intangible assets. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are recognized at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Convertible Senior Notes In February 2021, the Company issued in a private offering $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "Notes"), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional notes. The Notes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options . Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, debt with an embedded conversion feature shall accounted for in its entirety as a liability and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument shall be accounted for as attributable to the conversion feature unless the conversion feature is required to be accounted for separately as an embedded derivative or the conversion feature results in a premium that is subject to the guidance in ASC 470. The Notes issued in February 2021 are accounted for as a liability with no portion of the proceeds attributable to the conversion options as the conversion feature did not require separate accounting as a derivative, and the Notes did not involve a premium subject to the guidance in ASC 470. Simultaneously, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. Refer to Note 12, Debt for additional information. Cost of Revenue Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue consists of our portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and branded apparel product costs, including duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, depreciation of property and equipment, and certain costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Subscription Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content creation and cost to stream content to Members across the Company’s platform. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and overhead costs, instructor and production personnel costs, and depreciation of property and equipment, as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, content costs for past use, third-party platform streaming costs, and payment processing fees for monthly subscription billings. Music Royalty Fees The Company recognizes music royalty fees on all music it streams to Members as these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence of the royalties is primarily driven by content usage by the Company’s Members through the use of a paid subscription or as part of a free-trial offer and it is classified as subscription cost of revenue or sales and marketing expense, respectively, within the Company’s statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company’s license agreements with music rights holders may include provisions for advance royalty payments as well as minimum guarantees. When a minimum guarantee is paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded as an incremental cost to fulfill or a prepaid asset and amortized over the shorter of the period consumed or the term of the agreement. As the Company executes music license agreements with various music rights holders for go-forward usage, the Company may also simultaneously enter into a settlement agreement whereby the Company is released from all potential licensor claims regarding the Company’s alleged past use of copyrighted material in exchange for a negotiated payment. These are referred to as “content costs for past use” and are recorded within subscription cost of revenue. The Company has entered into agreements with music rights holders who represent all the music catalogs that the Company needs to operate its service, however, given the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights ownership, the Company’s archived library may continue to include music for which certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon license agreements previously entered into and the respective music rights holdings. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery of its deferred tax assets is not more-likely-than-not, a valuation allowance is established. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within income tax expense. Refer to Note 17, Income Taxes for additional information. Advertising Costs Advertising and other promotional costs to market the Company's products are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $362.6 million, $637.3 million, and $417.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included within Sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel- and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials software platform expenses, and depreciation of property and equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation In August 2019, the Company's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors") adopted the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to its ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is twenty-four months . The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at a 15 percent discount. The ESPP also includes a look-back provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date. In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ("the 2019 Plan"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For performance-based awards issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock, the expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards, the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company derived its volatility from the average historical stock volatilities of several peer public companies over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the expected volatility is based on a blended average of average historical stock volatilities of several peer companies over the expected term of the stock options, historical volatility of the Company's stock price, and implied stock price volatility derived from the price of exchange traded options on the Company's stock. The Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as the Company’s historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield is 0.0 % as the Company has not paid and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its common stock. Generally, the 2015 Stock Plan permitted the early exercise of stock options granted prior to the IPO. The unvested portion of shares exercised is recorded within Other current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs. Refer to Note 15, Equity-Based Compensation for additional information. Restructuring The Company's restructuring charges consist of employee severance, one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefits related to the reduction of its workforce, and other costs. One-time termination benefits are expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service beyond a minimum retention period, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period. Ongoing benefits are expensed when restructuring activities are probable and the benefit amounts are estimable. Liabilities for other costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value and are recognized when the liability is incurred. Other costs primarily consist of termination fees, idle rent and related expenses for exited locations, professional services, and other costs related to restructuring activities, and are expensed when incurred. Refer to Note 4, Restructuring for additional information. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan offered to all of its U.S. employees, as well as plans at certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company's matching contributions totaled $19.1 million, $26.3 million, and $19.6 million, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss. If a loss is probable and the loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: • Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities, and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company’s material financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and the convertible senior notes. The carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their fair values at June 30, 2023 and 2022, due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment. Refer to Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Earnings (Loss) Per Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s restricted stock awards and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. The Company considers any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock. These participating securities do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were not allocated to the Company’s participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, ESPP shares to be issued, and vesting of restricted stock awards. Refer to Note 18, Net Loss Per Share for additional information. Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among others, those related to revenue related reserves, the realizability of inventory, content costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements, the incremental borrowing rate associated with lease liabilities, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets, product warranty, goodwill, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, transaction price estimates, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and asset acquisitions, valuation of the debt component of convertible senior notes, contingent consideration, and commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted ASU 2020-06 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity . The guidance simplified the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, thereby limiting the accounting results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amended the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, the guidance eliminated the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The Company adopted the standard effective July 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective transition method. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a reduction to Additional paid-in capital of $160.1 million to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the Notes (as defined in Note 12 - Debt), an increase of $119.6 million in the carrying value of its Notes to reflect the full principal amount of the Notes outstanding net of issuance costs, and a decrease to Accumulated deficit of $40.6 million. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU 2021-08 In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The guidance requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance, which will depend on the contract assets and liabilities acquired in future business combinations. 3. Revenue The Company’s primary sources of revenue are its recurring content Subscription revenue, and revenue from the sales of its Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor branded fitness products, delivery and installation services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; • Determination of the transaction price; • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and • Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue is reported net of sales returns, discounts, incentives, and rebates to commercial distributors as a reduction of the transaction price. Certain contracts include consideration payable that is accounted for as a payment for distinct goods or services. The Company estimates its liability for product returns and concessions based on historical trends by product category, impact of seasonality, and an evaluation of current economic and market conditions and records the expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur. Some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Company generally determines the standalone selling price based on the prices charged to customers. The Company applies the practical expedient as per ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information related to remaining performance obligations due to their original expected terms being one year or less. The Company expenses sales commissions on its Connected Fitness Products when incurred because the amortization period would have been less than one year. These costs are recorded in Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Some of the Company’s revenues relate to our rental lease arrangements. Our rental program allows Members to lease a Bike or Bike+ with a Peloton Rental Membership for a single monthly cost and a one-time delivery fee, and gives the Member the option to purchase the equipment outright or cancel at any time with no penalty. These lease arrangements include both lease and non-lease components. Consideration is allocated between the lease and non-lease components based on management’s best estimate of the relative standalone selling price of each component. The lease component relates to the customer’s right to use the equipment over the lease term and is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease within Connected Fitness Products revenue, while the underlying equipment subject to the lease remains within Property and equipment, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciates over the equipment’s useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the underlying equipment is reflected in Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Non-lease components are primarily comprised of (1) an All-Access Membership, which is recognized within Subscription revenue, and (2) cycling shoes, which are recognized within Connected Fitness Products revenue, and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Products include the Company’s portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, Precor branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, Peloton branded apparel, extended warranty agreements, and commercial service contracts. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness Products revenue net of sales returns and discounts when the product has been delivered to the customer, except for extended warranty revenue that is recognized over the warranty period and service revenue that is recognized over the term of the service contract. The Company allows customers to return Peloton branded Connected Fitness Products within thirty days of purchase, as stated in its return policy. The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive. The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales for Connected Fitness Products within Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Subscription The Company’s subscriptions provide access to Peloton content in its library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Company’s subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month or prepaid basis. Amounts paid for subscription fees, net of refunds are included within Deferred revenue and customer deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized ratably over the subscription term. The Company records payment processing fees for its monthly subscription charges within cost of Subscription revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Product Warranty The Company offers a standard product warranty that its Connected Fitness Products will operate under normal, non-commercial use for a period of one year covering the touchscreen and most original Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row, and Guide components from the date of original delivery. The Company has the obligation, at its option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical as well as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty policies and business practices. The Company’s products are manufactured by contract manufacturers and, in certain cases, the Company may have recourse to such contract manufacturers. Activity related to the Company’s accrual for our estimated future product warranty obligation was as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $51.1 $51.5 Provision for warranty accrual 17.7 55.6 Warranty claims (42.4) (56.0) Balance at end of period $26.4 $51.1
============================================================

The Company also offers the option for customers in some markets to purchase a third-party extended warranty and service contract that extends or enhances the technical support, parts, and labor coverage offered as part of the base warranty included with the Connected Fitness Products for additional periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. Extended warranty revenue is recognized on a gross basis as the Company has a continuing obligation to perform over the service period. Extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period and is included in Connected Fitness Products revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company’s revenue disaggregated by segment, excluding sales-based taxes, is included in Note 19, Segment Information . The Company’s revenue disaggregated by geographic region was as follows:

============================================================

The Company’s revenue attributable to the United States was $2,496.3 million, $3,100.0 million and $3,577.1 million, representing 89 %, 87 % and 89 % of Total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred Revenue and Customer Deposits As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, customer deposits of $95.2 million and $109.2 million, respectively, and deferred revenue of $92.1 million and $91.9 million, respectively, were included in Deferred revenue and customer deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $92.4 million and $70.4 million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received for the Company’s performance obligation to transfer, or stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. Customer deposits represent payments received in advance before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer and are refundable. 4. Restructuring In February 2022, we announced and began implementing a restructuring plan to realign the Company’s operational focus to support its multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). The Restructuring Plan originally included: (i) reducing the Company’s headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for the Company’s previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities; and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations. The Company expects the Restructuring Plan to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal 2024. In fiscal year 2023 we continued to take actions to implement the Restructuring Plan. On July 12, 2022, the Company announced it is exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding its current relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer, Rexon Industrial Corp. Additionally, on August 12, 2022, the Company announced the decision to perform the following restructuring activities: (i) fully transitioning its North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of its delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminating a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exiting its real-estate footprints in its Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reducing its retail showroom presence. As a result of the Restructuring Plan, the Company incurred the following charges, of which Asset write-downs and write-offs are included within Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The remaining charges incurred due to the Restructuring Plan are included within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss:

============================================================

____________________________ (1) Write-offs of inventory are included within Cost of revenue: Connected Fitness Products in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, the Company committed to the closures of certain warehouse and retail locations, the discontinuation of manufacturing in North America, and the wind down of certain software implementation and development projects. Due to the actions taken, the Company tested certain long-lived assets (asset groups) for recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the asset group to estimates of their future undiscounted cash flows, which were generally the liquidation value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, income from a sublease arrangement. Based on the results of the recoverability tests, the Company determined that during the year ended June 30, 2023 , the undiscounted cash flows of certain assets (asset groups) were below their carrying values, indicating impairment. The assets were written down to their estimated fair values, which were determined based on their estimated liquidation or sales value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, discounted cash flows of a sublease arrangement. The following table presents a roll-forward of cash restructuring-related liabilities, which is included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

============================================================

In addition to the above charges, the Company incurred capital expenditures related to Peloton Output Park of approximately $1.9 million and $86.6 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, the Company estimates that it will incur additional cash charges of approximately $40.0 million, primarily composed of lease termination and other exit costs, by the end of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, the Company expects to recognize additional non-cash charges of approximately $20.0 million during fiscal year 2024, primarily composed of non-inventory asset impairment charges in connection with the Restructuring Plan. 5.

_________________________ (1) Includes $26.4 million and $36.4 million of finished goods inventory in transit, products owned by the Company that have not yet been received at a Company distribution center, as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company periodically assesses and adjusts the value of inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. The Company recorded inventory reserves as of June 30, 2023 primarily in the amounts of $105.6 million related to returned Connected Fitness Products that the Company does not expect to sell and $97.8 million related to excess accessories and apparel inventory that the Company does not expect to sell above its current carrying value. 7. Acquisitions Business Combination During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company completed two transactions to acquire certain developed software and assembled workforce for use in the development of the Company’s data platform and content supply chain. The transactions were completed on November 1, 2021 and November 8, 2021, and were accounted for as a business combination and asset acquisition, respectively. The acquisitions resulted in the recognition of $12.0 million of goodwill, and $17.7 million of assets primarily consisting of developed software. The developed software was assigned a useful life of 3 years and is recorded in Property and equipment, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following:

============================================================

_________________________ (1) Includes $1.0 million and $31.5 million of software under development as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had impairment triggering events, including (i) realignment of cost structure in connection with the Restructuring Plan, (ii) softening demand and (iii) a sustained decrease in stock price. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain asset groups. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $32.5 million related to capitalized software, $19.5 million related to exiting certain corporate office locations, $17.2 million relating to exiting retail showrooms, $16.5 million related to Connected Fitness assets, and $8.2 million related to other manufacturing assets. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of impairment loss of $57.6 million related to Connected Fitness assets, $21.3 million related to manufacturing equipment, $19.0 million related to Peloton Output Park and $15.9 million related to acquired technology. These impairment charges reduced the carrying value of these asset groups from $222.9 million to $109.1 million. Additionally, management identified changes to the product and enterprise technology roadmaps that indicated that certain programs no longer had expected future use. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $54.1 million related to software under development that reduced the carrying value of those assets from $61.0 million to $6.9 million. Impairment charges are included within Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. There were no material impairments in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2023, 79 % and 15 % of the Company's total Property and equipment, net was attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, 82 % and 11 % of the Company's total Property and equipment, net was attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist (“a triggering event”). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, management identified no qualitative factors that collectively, indicated that the Company had triggering events. The Company did not recognize goodwill impairment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $181.9 million representing the entire amount of goodwill related to the Connected Fitness Products reporting unit in the Connected Fitness Products segment. The gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and impairment of the Company's Intangible assets, net, as of June 30, 2023 were as follows:

During fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized no intangible asset impairment loss. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $165.6 million, primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired developed technology, brand, distributor and customer relationships, and assembled workforce, which resulted from strategic actions taken by the Company under the Restructuring Plan. The Company determined that the estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain intangibles. The impairment loss was included in Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company recognized intangible asset amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the amount of $15.8 million, $43.3 million, and $19.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, estimated amortization related to the Company's identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets in future periods were as follows:

============================================================

_________________________ (1) Accrued settlement costs consist primarily of payments made to third-party suppliers to terminate certain future inventory purchase commitments . 11. Leases Lessee arrangements The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various expiration dates through 2039. The Company leases space for its corporate headquarters and the operation of its distribution facilities, warehouses, factories, showrooms, production studio facilities, and other office spaces. The Company does not have any material finance leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are established on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for leases with an expected term greater than one year. As the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable, the Company uses its secured incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate and equipment leases. The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company's lease terms include options to extend or terminate the underlying lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The operating lease arrangements included in the measurement of lease liabilities do not reflect options to extend or terminate, as management does not consider the exercise of these options to be reasonably certain. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. The Company calculates the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, percentage of sales, common area charges, taxes paid by the landlord that are charged to the Company, and changes to the consumer price index. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. The Company subleases certain warehouses, office spaces, and showroom spaces to third parties, which does not relieve the Company of its primary lease obligations with the lessor (the “head lease”). These subleases are classified as operating leases, and therefore the Company continues to account for the head lease as it did before the commencement date of the sublease. Sublease income is presented within the same category of cost of revenue or operating expenses as the underlying head lease expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, the Company assesses the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions of ASC 360. Total operating lease expense, net, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows:

As discussed in Note 8 - Property and Equipment, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had triggering events for our long-lived assets, including the Company’s right-of-use assets. The Company recognized impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $6.4 million related to certain corporate office right-of-use assets, $5.3 million related to Connected Fitness right-of-use assets, $3.0 million related to retail showroom right-of-use assets, and $1.2 million related to other manufacturing right-of-use assets. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges of $28.5 million related to Connected Fitness right-of-use assets, which reduced the carrying value of these right-of-use assets from $161.2 million to $132.7 million. Impairment charges are included within Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. There were no material impairments in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Lessor arrangements As discussed in Note 3 - Revenue, the Company leases certain Connected Fitness equipment under our rental program. The lease arrangement provides the customer with an option to purchase the underlying equipment or terminate the lease at any time. The price to purchase the underlying equipment is determined based on the number of months that the customer has leased the equipment, and is not considered a bargain purchase option. All rental lease agreements are considered operating leases, and the Company currently does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases as a lessor. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized lease revenue on our rental program of $19.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, within Connected Fitness Products revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 12. Debt Convertible Notes and the Indenture In February 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the over-allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of $125.0 million. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes does not accrete. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $977.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the Company’s offering expenses. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes is initially convertible into 4.1800 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $239.23 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events in the future. On or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. It is the Company’s current intent to settle the principal amount of the Notes with cash. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, on or after February 20, 2024 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the Notes periodically. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of current or future subsidiaries of the Company (including trade payables and to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof, preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries). The net carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes was as follows:

The following table sets forth the interest expense recognized related to the Notes:

============================================================

____________________________ (1) The decreases in total interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were due to the derecognition of the unamortized debt discount, partially offset by the increases in the amortization of issuance costs previously recognized in equity. These changes were the result of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2020-06, as of July 1, 2022, as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Capped Call Transactions In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). The Capped Call Transactions have an initial strike price of approximately $239.23 per share, subject to adjustments, which corresponds to the approximate initial conversion price of the Notes. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions will initially be approximately $362.48 per share. The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, 6.9 million shares of Class A common stock. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. If, however, the market price per share of Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. For accounting purposes, the Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. The net cost of $81.3 million incurred to purchase the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (as amended, modified, or supplemented prior to entrance into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided for a $500.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of $250.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the issuance of letters of credit. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also permitted the incurrence of indebtedness to permit the Capped Call Transactions and issuance of the Notes. On May 25, 2022, the Company entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (and as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain banks and financial institutions party thereto as lenders and issuing banks. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company amended and restated the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $750.0 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), which will be due and payable on May 25, 2027 or, if greater than $200.0 million of the Notes are outstanding on November 16, 2025 (the “Springing Maturity Condition”), November 16, 2025 (the “Springing Maturity Date”). The Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 0.25 %, payable at the end of each fiscal quarter and on the maturity date. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provided for a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), $35.0 million of which would mature on June 20, 2024 (the “Non-Consenting Commitments”), with the rest ($465.0 million) maturing on December 10, 2026 (the “Consenting Commitments”) or if the Springing Maturity Condition is met and the Term Loan is outstanding on such date, the Springing Maturity Date. On August 24, 2022, the Company amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment”) such that the Company is only required to meet the total liquidity covenant, set at $250.0 million (the “Liquidity Covenant”), and the total revenues covenant, set at $3.0 billion for the four-quarter trailing period, to the extent any revolving loans are borrowed and outstanding. On May 2, 202 3, the Company further amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to, among other things, (i) reduce the aggregate revolving credit commitments from $500.0 million to $400.0 million, with the Non-Consenting Commitments reduced to $28.0 million and the Consenting Commitments reduced to $372.0 million, and (ii) remove the covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum total four-quarter revenue level of $3.0 billion at any time when revolving loans are outstanding. Following the Second Amendment, borrowings under the Revolving Facility are limited to the lesser of (a) $400.0 million and (b) an amount equal to the “Subscription” revenue of the Company and its subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the Company. The Liquidity Covenant will still be replaced with a covenant to maintain a minimum secured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio upon our meeting a specified adjusted EBITDA threshold. The Revolving Facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 2.25 % per annum or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 1.25 % per annum for the Consenting Commitments, and bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 2.75 % per annum or the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.75 % per annum for the Non-Consenting Commitments. The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.325 % per annum and 0.375 % per annum on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility for the Consenting Commitments and the Non-Consenting Commitments, respectively. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 5.50 % per annum or the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 6.50 % per annum. As stipulated in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the applicable rates applicable to the Term Loan increased one time by 0.50 % per annum as the Company chose not to obtain a public rating for the Term Loan from S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. on or prior to November 25, 2022. Any borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate is subject to a 1.00 % floor and a term loan borrowed at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate is subject to a 0.50 % floor and any revolving loan borrowed at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate is subject to a 0.00 % floor. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants as well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. Certain baskets and covenant levels have been decreased and will apply equally to both the Term Loan and Revolving Facility for so long as the Term Loan is outstanding. After the repayment in full of the Term Loan, such baskets and levels will revert to those previously disclosed in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, with certain exceptions set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and are required to be guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company if, at the end of future financial quarters, certain conditions are not met. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred total commitment fees of $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, which are included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had drawn the full amount of the Term Loan and had not drawn on the Revolving Facility, and the Company had $742.5 million total outstanding borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, which are capitalized and presented as Other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of cash and cash equivalents as collateral for standby letters of credit. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $71.6 million, which is classified as Restricted cash on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s proceeds in connection with the Term Loan were $696.4 million, net of discount of $33.8 million and issuance costs of $19.8 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan using the effective interest rate method. Upon entering into the Term Loan, the effective interest rate was 10.2 %. On each of November 25, 2022 and May 25, 2023, the rate was updated to 13.7 % and 14.3 %, respectively. The net carrying amount of the Term Loan was as follows:

Return reserves related to the impacts of the Tread+ recall of $24.4 million and $39.9 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively . Accruals for costs associated with the Tread+ repair of $10.0 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 . The estimated return reserves are based on historical and expected product returns. The estimated costs associated with the Tread+ repair are primarily based on the estimated number of requests for the Tread+ repair and the estimated costs of the production, delivery and installation of the remedy. Bike Seat Post Recall On May 11, 2023, in collaboration with the CPSC, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the original Peloton model Bikes (not Bike+) seat posts sold in the U.S. from January 2018 to May 2023, and is offering Members a free replacement seat post as the approved repair. As a result of this recall, the Company recognized $48.4 million for the cost to replace the bike seat posts, reflected in Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, accruals of $42.2 million were included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The estimated cost to replace the bike seat posts is primarily based on the estimated number of requests for seat posts and the estimated costs of the production and shipment of the replacement parts. For more detail on the potential impacts of the recall to our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members—Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects or product safety issues, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation.” Commitments to Suppliers The Company utilizes contract manufacturers to build its products and accessories. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information the Company supplies, which typically covers a rolling 12-month period. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires inventories from such manufacturers through blanket purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information and availability of goods. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods that range a number of months. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and/or adjust our requirements based on its business needs for a period of time before the order is due to be fulfilled. While the Company’s purchase orders are legally cancellable in many situations, there are some which are not cancellable in the event of a demand plan change or other circumstances, such as where the supplier has procured unique, Peloton-specific designs, and/or specific non-cancellable, non-returnable components based on our provided forecasts. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s commitments to contract with third-party manufacturers for their inventory on-hand and component purchase commitments related to the manufacture of Peloton products were estimated to be approximately $174.6 million. Supplier Settlements During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred $22.0 million in settlement agreements with various third-party suppliers to terminate certain future inventory purchase commitments. The Company paid $268.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings The Company is, or may become, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. For example, in May 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall of our Tread+ product in collaboration with the CPSC. In December 2022, to continue our cooperation with the CPSC, we entered into a settlement agreement with the CPSC regarding matters related to the Tread+ recall. In the settlement, which was publicly announced in January 2023, we agreed to pay a $19.1 million civil penalty, resolving the CPSC’s charges that we violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”). On May 18, 2023, the Company and the CPSC jointly announced the approval of a rear guard repair for the recalled Tread+. The SEC is also investigating our public disclosures concerning the recall, as well as other matters In addition, in 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Department of Homeland Security subpoenaed us for documents and other information related to our statutory obligations under the CPSA, and they are continuing to investigate. In addition to the regulatory investigations, we are presently subject to class action litigation and private personal injury claims related to these perceived defects in the Tread+ and incidents reported to result from its use. On May 11, 2023, in collaboration with the CPSC, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the original Peloton model Bikes (not Bike+) sold in the U.S. from January 2018 to May 2023. On May 17, 2023, Brandy Miller filed suit against Peloton on behalf of a putative nationwide class of Bike purchasers in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, Case No. 3:23-cv-02101-MGL. Plaintiff Miller alleges that, as demonstrated by the seat post recall, the Bike was defective when sold, and she brings claims of unjust enrichment, breaches of express and implied warranties, breach of contract, negligence, and design and manufacturing defects. The Company moved to compel arbitration and dismiss the complaint on July 31, 2023. On June 9, 2023, Sam Solomon filed suit against Peloton and certain of its current or former officers on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired Peloton securities between May 10, 2022 and May 10, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Case No. 1:23-cv-04279-MKB-JRC. Plaintiff Solomon alleges that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements or omissions relating to the seat post recall in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Additionally on April 29, 2021, Ashley Wilson filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company and certain of its officers, captioned Wilson v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02369-CBA-PK, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the "Wilson Action"), and on May 24, 2021, Leigh Drori filed a related putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned Drori v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02925-CBA-PK, also in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Drori Action”). On November 16, 2021, the district judge consolidated the Wilson and Drori Actions under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 21-cv-02369-CBA-PK, and appointed Richard Neswick as lead plaintiff. On January 21, 2022, lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint in the action purportedly on behalf of a class consisting of those individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between September 11, 2020 and May 5, 2021. Lead plaintiff alleges that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company’s Tread and Tread+ products and the safety of those products. Defendants served their motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint on March 7, 2022, and briefing was complete on April 26, 2022. A hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on June 8, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the parties reached a settlement-in-principle, and on December 16, 2022, the court stayed the action in light of that settlement-in-principle. On April 17, 2023, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the action for $14.0 million, for which the Company had previously taken a reserve, and submitted the agreement to the court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, defendants continue to deny any liability or wrongdoing. The settlement remains subject to court approval. On May 20, 2021, Alan Chu filed a verified shareholder derivative action lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors, captioned Chu v. Foley, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02862, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Chu Action”). Plaintiff Chu alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. On August 13, 2021 and August 19, 2021, two related verified shareholder derivative complaints were filed, captioned Genack v. Foley, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-04583 and Liu v. Foley, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-04687, also purportedly on behalf of the Company, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On October 13, 2021, the parties in the three putative derivative actions filed a stipulation seeking to consolidate the actions, and agreeing to a schedule for plaintiffs to file motions to be appointed lead plaintiff. On October 26, 2021, the court entered the stipulation consolidating the three actions under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Master File No. 21-cv-02862-CBA-PK. On November 23, 2021, Anthony Franchi filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors captioned Franchi v. Blachford, et al., Case No. CV 21-06544 (the “Franchi Action”), which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On January 24, 2022, the court entered a stipulation consolidating the Franchi Action into In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Derivative Litigation (the “EDNY Derivative Action”) and appointed each plaintiff a co-lead plaintiff. On February 3, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation to stay the consolidated derivative action, which the Court entered on February 11, 2022, and the case remains stayed. On November 18, 2022 and December 8, 2022, respectively, stockholders Krikor Arslanian and Michael Smith filed putative verified stockholder derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s executive officers and directors (the “Chancery Actions”), captioned Arslanian v. Blachford, et al., Case No. 2022-1051-KSJM and Smith v. Boone, et al., Case No. 2022-1138-KSJM, asserting similar allegations to those made in the EDNY Derivative Action. On December 14, 2022, the Chancery Actions were consolidated as In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation and stayed. On December 22, 2022, putative shareholder Charles Blackburn filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting similar allegations to those in the EDNY Derivative Action and the Chancery Actions against certain current and former Company officers and directors, captioned Blackburn v. Foley, et al., Case No. 22-cv-01618-GBW. On November 18, 2021, the City of Hialeah Employees’ Retirement System filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned City of Hialeah Employees’ Retirement System v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., Case No. 21-cv-09582-ALC (the “Hialeah Action”), and on December 2, 2021, Anastasia Deulina filed a related putative securities class action against the same defendants also in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned Deulina v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., Case No. 21-cv-10266-ALC (the “Deulina Action”). On May 5, 2022, the Court consolidated the Hialeah and Deulina Actions and appointed Robeco Capital Growth Funds SICAV – Robeco Global Consumer Trends as lead plaintiff. Lead plaintiff filed its amended complaint on June 25, 2022, purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s common stock between February 5, 2021 and January 19, 2022 against the Company and certain of its current and former officers, alleging that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements about demand for the Company’s products and the reasons for the Company’s inventory growth, and engaged in improper trading in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act. Defendants moved to dismiss, and on March 30, 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on May 6, 2023, and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on June 16, 2023. Briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint was completed on August 18, 2023. On February 21, 2023 stockholders Allison Manzella and Clark Ovruchesky filed a putative verified stockholder derivative action in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors, captioned Manzella v. Cortese, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0224-KSJM, alleging the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by purportedly making false statements about demand for the Company’s products and engaging in improper trading. On March 20, 2023 and April 28, 2023, stockholders Daniel Banks and Karen Florentino, respectively, likewise filed putative verified stockholder derivative actions in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware on behalf of the Company, captioned Banks v. Foley, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0340-KSJM, and Florentino v. Cortese, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0468-KSJM, asserting substantially similar allegations. On July 26, 2023, the Manzella, Banks, and Florentino actions were consolidated under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. 2023 Derivative Litigation, Consol. Case No. 2023-0224-KSJM. In April 2021, DISH Technologies L.L.C., and Sling TV L.L.C. (“DISH”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. DISH, and along with DISH DBS Corporation, also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company, along with ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. (now iFIT Inc. f/k/a Icon Health & Fitness, Inc.), FreeMotion Fitness, Inc., NordicTrack, Inc., lululemon athletica, inc., and Curiouser Products Inc. d/b/a MIRROR. The complaints alleged infringement of various patents related to fitness devices containing internet-streaming enabled video displays. In the ITC matter, on September 9, 2022, an Initial Determination was issued recommending that the ITC enter an exclusion order and a cease and desist order against Peloton’s importation and sale of Bike, Bike+, Tread and Tread+ products (and others that operate similarly) on the basis that those products infringed all four asserted patents of DISH. On March 8, 2023, the ITC issued an opinion finding that Peloton had imported products which infringe certain claims of the patents asserted by DISH. On the basis of that finding, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order (“remedial orders”). The remedial orders were subject to a 60-day Presidential Review Period ending on May 7, 2023. Absent presidential disapproval, after May 7, 2023, the remedial orders would have prohibited (i) the sale, distribution, marketing, transferring, or advertising in the United States of products that have the infringing functionality installed on them, and (ii) the importation of such products unless and until Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) deems them non-infringing . On May 1, 2023, Peloton executed a Settlement, Patent License, and Release Agreement with DISH resolving the ITC matter and the Eastern District of Texas matter, pursuant to which Peloton paid a one time settlement payment of $75.0 million to DISH and DISH has terminated the related legal proceedings. On August 4, 2022, Mayville Engineering Company, Inc. (“MEC”) filed suit against Peloton in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Index No. 652735/2022, alleging claims for breach of contract, or, in the alternative, breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. MEC alleges that Peloton breached a supply agreement under which MEC agreed to supply certain parts for Peloton products, and that it is entitled to damages in an amount exceeding $107.0 million, plus pre-judgment interest, fees, and costs. On September 23, 2022, Peloton moved to dismiss MEC's complaint. On January 6, 2023, the Court partially granted and partially denied Peloton's motion to dismiss, dismissing MEC’s alternative claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing with prejudice, but allowing MEC's claim for breach of contract to move forward. The matter is ongoing. We dispute the allegations in the above-referenced active matters and intend to defend the matters vigorously. Some of our legal and regulatory proceedings, such as the above-referenced matters and litigation that centers around intellectual property claims, may be based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except where otherwise indicated, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages for any of the above matters, and therefore, the Company has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability, and, if the liability is material, discloses the amount of the liability reserved. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 14. Stockholders' Equity On November 16, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “Representatives”) relating to the offer and sale by the Company (the “Offering”) of 27,173,912 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.000025 per share, which includes 3,260,869 shares of Class A common stock issued and sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The Company sold the Shares to the underwriters at the public offering price of $46.00 per share less underwriting discounts . The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $1.2 billion after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s offering expenses. 15. Equity-Based Compensation 2019 Equity Incentive Plan In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Plan, which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. The 2019 Plan serves as the successor to the 2015 Stock Plan (the "2015 Plan"). The 2015 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. Any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2015 Plan on the effective date of the 2019 Plan became available for grant under the 2019 Plan and will be issued as Class A common stock. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock equal to 5 % of the total outstanding shares of all of the Company’s classes of common stock as of each June 30 immediately preceding the date of increase, or a lesser amount as determined by the Board of Directors. On July 1, 2022, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan was automatically increased according to its terms by 16,913,700 shares. As of June 30, 2023, 43,075,791 shares of Class A common stock are available for future award under the 2019 Plan. Stock Options The following summary sets forth the stock option activity under the 2019 Plan:

============================================================

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and vested and exercisable, were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock as of June 30, 2023. The fair value of the common stock is the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $85.1 million, $376.3 million, and $1,216.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. On July 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-time repricing of certain stock option awards that had been granted to date under the 2019 Plan. The repricing impacted stock options held by all employees who remained employed through July 25, 2022. The repricing did not apply to our U.S.-based hourly employees (or employees with equivalent roles in non-U.S. locations) or our C-level executives. The original exercise prices of the repriced stock options ranged from $12.94 to $146.79 per share for the 2,138 total grantees. Each stock option was repriced to have a per share exercise price of $9.13 , which was the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on July 1, 2022. There were no changes to the number of shares, the vesting schedule or the expiration date of the repriced stock options. Incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the repricing was $21.9 million in the aggregate. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the weighted-average grant date fair value per option was $6.42 , $22.27 , and $43.76 , respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes method with the following assumptions:

============================================================

Employee Stock Purchase Plan In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted, and in September 2019, the Company's stockholders approved, the ESPP, through which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at a discount through accumulated payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on the date the registration statement, in connection with the Company’s IPO, was declared effective by the SEC (the "Effective Date"). The number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock that will be available for issuance and sale to eligible employees under the ESPP will increase automatically on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company beginning on July 1, 2020 through 2029, equal to 1 % of the total number of outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's common stock on the immediately preceding June 30, or such lesser number as may be determined by the Board of Directors or applicable committee in its sole discretion. On July 1, 2022, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was automatically increased according to its terms by 3,382,740 shares. As of June 30, 2023, a total of 12,626,752 shares of Class A common stock were available for sale to employees under the ESPP. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each offering period will consist of four six-month purchase periods, provided that the initial offering period commenced on the Effective Date and ended on August 31, 2021, and the initial purchase period ended February 28, 2020. Thereafter, each offering period and each purchase period will commence on September 1 and March 1 and end on August 31 and February 28 of each two-year period or each six-month period, respectively, subject to a reset provision. If the closing stock price on the first day of an offering period is higher than the closing stock price on the last day of any applicable purchase period, participants will be withdrawn from the ongoing offering period immediately following the purchase of ESPP shares on the purchase date and would automatically be enrolled in the subsequent offering period (“ESPP reset”), resulting in a modification under ASC 718. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the purchase price for each share of Class A common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value per share on the first trading day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share on the last trading day of the applicable purchase period. During the year ended June 30, 2023, there were ESPP resets that resulted in total modification charges of $2.7 million, which is recognized over the new two-year offering period ending February 28, 2024. The Black-Scholes option pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of shares estimated to be purchased at the commencement of the ESPP offering periods were as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 Weighted average risk-free interest rate 0.9 % Weighted average expected term (in years) 1.3 Weighted average expected volatility 88.2 % Expected dividend yield —
============================================================

The expected term assumptions were based on each offering period's respective purchase date. The expected volatility was derived from the blended average of historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies that the Company considers to be comparable to its business over a period equivalent to the expected terms of the stock options and the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. Beginning in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. The risk-free rate assumptions were based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grants. The dividend yield assumption was zero as the Company has not historically paid any dividends and does not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded Stock-based compensation expense associated with the ESPP of $17.3 million, $13.0 million, and $9.5 million respectively. In connection with the offering period which ended on August 31, 2022, employees purchased 386,121 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted-average price of $8.66 under the ESPP. In connection with the offering period ended on February 28, 2023, employees purchased under the ESPP 518,326 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted-average price of $8.74 . As of June 30, 2023, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP was $8.0 million, which will be amortized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.7 years. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The Company's total stock-based compensation expense was as follows:

============================================================

============================================================

As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $570.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, 13 employees of the Company who were eligible to participate in the Company’s Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Severance Plan”) terminated employment. Certain modifications were made to equity awards, including, in certain instances, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 90 days to one year (or the option expiration date, if earlier), and extended vesting was tied to certain consulting services that were deemed to be non-substantive. In one instance, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 90 days to approximately 2.8 years. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental Stock-based compensation expense of $49.6 million within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 16. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Vendors Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no customers representing greater than 10% of the Company’s Total revenue. The Company's top three vendors accounted for approximately 78 % of inventory purchased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The Company's top two vendors accounted for approximately 60 % and 46 % of inventory purchased for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the Company’s products require one or more components that are available from only a single source. 17.

The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 are due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation, and state and international taxes. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits, and state and international taxes. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits, and state and international taxes. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% minimum tax rate applied to corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and also includes an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock. The Company has reviewed the provisions of the law and does not believe that any of the provisions will have a material impact on the business. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan was enacted, which extends the period companies can claim an Employee Retention Credit, expands the IRC Section 162(m) limit on deductions for publicly traded companies, and repeals the election that allows US affiliate groups to allocate interest expense on a worldwide basis, among other provisions. The Company reviewed the provisions of the law and determined it had no material impact for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. On December 21, 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The act includes the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 and the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, both of which extend many credits and other COVID-19 relief, among other extensions. The Company evaluated the provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, including but not limited to the Employee Retention Credit extension, the extension for the IRC Section 45S credit for paid family and medical leave, and the provision allowing a full deduction for certain business meals, and determined that there was no material impact for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”), non-qualified stock options, accruals and reserves, lease liability, research and development tax credits, §263A UNICAP, and Section 174 capitalized expenditures. A valuation allowance was maintained and/or established in substantially all jurisdictions on the Company’s gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. As of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Company continued to maintain that it is not at the more likely than not standard, wherein deferred taxes will be realized due to the recent history of losses and management’s expectation of continued tax losses. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

============================================================

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had federal NOLs of approximately $3,101.6 million and $2,896.7 million, respectively, of which $64.8 million will begin to expire in 2034 and the remainder will be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone three ownership changes in the past which have historically subjected its NOLs to a Section 382 limitation. The resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section 382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022, therefore no NOLs are currently limited. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had state NOLs of approximately $2,309.9 million and $2,130.0 million, respectively, which began to expire at various dates beginning in 2023 if not utilized. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had foreign NOLs of approximately $609.7 million and $458.3 million, respectively, generated primarily from its operations in the United Kingdom, which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $71.9 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of federal U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2036. As of June 30, 2023, the Company did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognize and measure unrecognized tax benefits. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within Income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). At both June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits included as a component of income taxes payable within accrued expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits:

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Beginning balance $— $0.7 Gross (decrease) increase in unrecognized tax positions $— $(0.7) Ending balance $— $—
============================================================

Although it is possible that unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, as well as foreign jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Accordingly, on a continuing basis, the Company cooperates with taxing authorities for the various jurisdictions in which it conducts business to comply with audits and inquiries for tax periods that are open to examination. The tax years ended June 30, 2020 and later remain open to examination by tax authorities in the United States and United Kingdom. 18. Net Loss Per Share The computation of loss per share is as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Basic loss per share: Net loss attributable to common stockholders $(1,261.7) $(2,827.7) $(189.0) Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 346,670,699 322,368,818 293,892,643 Basic loss per share $(3.64) $(8.77) $(0.64)
============================================================

Basic and diluted loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. The following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect would have been anti-dilutive:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Employee stock options 13,742,253 36,846,242 54,076,445 Restricted stock units and awards 1,408,482 174,580 546,687 Shares estimated to be purchased under ESPP — 28,370 363,741
============================================================

Impact of 2021 Notes The conversion option will have a dilutive impact on net income per share of common stock when the average market price per share of the Company's Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the Notes of $239.23 per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the weighted average price per share of the Company's Class A common stock was below the conversion price of the Notes. The denominator for basic and diluted loss per share does not include any effect from the Capped Call Transactions the Company entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Notes as this effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Notes, if shares are delivered to the Company under the Capped Call Transactions, they will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company would issue under the Notes. 19. Segment Information The Company applies ASC 280, Segment Reporting , in determining reportable segments. The Company has two reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products and Subscription. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for both of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segment. The Connected Fitness Products segment derives revenue from sale of the Company's portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, delivery and installation services, branded apparel, and extended warranty agreements. The Subscription segment derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments. Key financial performance measures of the segments including Revenue, Cost of revenue, and Gross profit are as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Connected Fitness Products: Revenue $1,130.2 $2,187.5 $3,149.6 Cost of revenue 1,328.8 2,433.8 2,236.9 Gross profit $(198.6) $(246.3) $912.7 Subscription: Revenue $1,670.1 $1,394.7 $872.2 Cost of revenue 547.9 450.0 330.5 Gross profit $1,122.1 $944.7 $541.7 Consolidated: Revenue $2,800.2 $3,582.1 $4,021.8 Cost of revenue 1,876.7 2,883.8 2,567.4 Gross profit $923.5 $698.4 $1,454.4
============================================================

Reconciliation of Gross Profit Operating expenditures, interest income and other expense, and taxes are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an entity wide group basis. The reconciliation between reportable Segment Gross Profit to consolidated loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes is as follows:

============================================================
