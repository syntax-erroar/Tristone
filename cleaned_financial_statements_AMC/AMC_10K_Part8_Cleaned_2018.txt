Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Kansas City, Missouri February 28, 2019 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition of revenue and certain costs in the 2018 consolidated financial statements due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 NOTE 1 – THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. On March 31, 2016, AMC Entertainment Inc. merged with and into Holdings, its direct parent company. In connection with the merger, Holdings assumed all of the obligations pursuant to the indentures to the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 (“Notes due 2022”), the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 (“Notes due 2025”) and the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as subsequently amended). As of December 31, 2018, Wanda owned approximately 50.01% of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 75.01% of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no noncontrolling (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, all of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to controlling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Revenues: The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recognized at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100% of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 12% to 18% of the current month sales, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Prior to January 1, 2018, income for non-redeemed exchange tickets were recognized 18 months after purchase when the redemption of these items was determined to be remote. At January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets to the proportional method, where it applies a non-redemption rate of 10% to the current month sales, and the Company recognizes the total amount of income for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. Management believes the 24-month estimate is supported by its continued development of redemption history and that it is reflective of management’s current best estimate. The adoption of the proportional method of recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded online ticket fee revenues net of third-party commission or service fees. In accordance with ASC 606 guidance, the Company believes that it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. These changes did not have any impact on net income or cash flows from operations. Film Exhibition Costs: Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded film payables of $168.6 million and $229.4 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Food and Beverage Costs: The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement: The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s ESA with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 – Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5% to 8.5%, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect transition adjustment of initially applying ASC 606 by increasing accumulated deficit on January 1, 2018 by approximately $52.9 million, including income tax effect of $0, as a result of this change. These changes did not have any impact on the Company’s cash flows from operations. Customer Frequency Program: AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. Once an AMC Stubs Premiere TM or AMC Stubs Insider TM member accumulates 5,000 points they will earn a $5.00 virtual reward. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. Converted rewards not redeemed within nine months are forfeited and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. Prior to January 1, 2018, rewards for expired memberships were forfeited based upon specified periods of inactivity of the membership and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. As of January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing forfeited rewards from the remote method to the proportional method, where the Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. On June 20, 2018, the Company announced the launch of AMC Stubs ® A-List, a new tier of our AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 to $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs: The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $45.4 million, $39.9 million, and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability: The Company remeasures the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B Common Stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other income related to increases in its derivative asset fair value of $45.0 million and other income related to decreases in its derivative liability fair value of $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings and Capital and Financing Lease Obligations, Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity and Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for further discussions. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets were recorded at fair value, in the case of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to theatre leases acquired under favorable terms, management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. There were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. Investments: The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment income. Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 – Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2018, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.4% interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50% interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0% interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29% interest in DCIP, a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6% interest in DCDC, a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 50% ownership interest in four U.S. motion picture theatres and one IMAX ® screen; and approximately 50% ownership interest in 58 theatres in Europe acquired in the Nordic acquisition. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company is not required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings; however, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill for impairment. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $4,788.7 million and $4,931.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. The Company’s goodwill is recorded in each of its three reporting units for its Domestic Theatres, Odeon Theatres, and Nordic Theatres. The Company performed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of calendar 2018 and the third quarter and fourth quarter of calendar 2017 and reached a determination that there was no goodwill or trademark and trade name impairment. According to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-20, the Company has an option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. As of October 1, 2018, the Company performed a step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test on the Odeon and Nordic reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore, no impairment charge was incurred. As of December 31, 2018, the Company assessed qualitative factors for all three reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore no impairment charge was incurred. During the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, and as of December 31, 2017, the Company assessed qualitative factors of all three reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore, no impairment charge was incurred. Other Long-term Assets : Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable: Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $42.6 million and $72.8 million, respectively. Leases: The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years, with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years. The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index not to exceed certain specified amounts and contingent rentals based on revenues. The Company records rent expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the initial base lease term commencing with the date the Company has “control and access” to the leased premises, which is generally a date prior to the “lease commencement date” in the lease agreement. Rent expense related to any “rent holiday” is recorded as operating expense, until construction of the leased premises is complete and the premises are ready for their intended use. Rent charges upon completion of the leased premises subsequent to the date the premises are ready for their intended use are expensed as a component of rent expense. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as deferred rent and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. The Company evaluates the classification of its leases following the guidance in ASC 840-10-25. Leases that qualify as capital leases are generally recorded at the present value of the future minimum rentals over the base term of the lease using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Capital lease assets are assigned an estimated useful life at the inception of the lease that generally corresponds with the base term of the lease. Occasionally, the Company or other theatre operators it has acquired are responsible for the construction of new leased theatres (build-to-suit lease arrangements) and for paying project costs that are in excess of an agreed upon amount to be reimbursed from the developer. ASC 840-40-05-5 requires the Company to be considered the owner (for accounting purposes) of these types of projects during the construction period and therefore it is required to account for these projects as sale and leaseback transactions. As a result, the Company has recorded financing lease obligations for failed sale leaseback transactions of $427.4 million and $499.6 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these types of projects as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company modified the terms of an existing operating lease to reduce the lease term. The Company received a $35.0 million incentive from the landlord to enter into the new lease agreement. The Company has recorded amortization of the lease incentive as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term which reduced rent expense by $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Sale and Leaseback Transactions: The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC 840-40. Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs of $50.1 million. The gain on the sale of approximately $27.3 million has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining lease term. On September 14, 2017, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with seven theatres for proceeds net of closing costs of $128.4 million. The gain on sale of approximately $78.2 million has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining lease term. On December 18, 2017, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds net of closing costs of $7.8 million. The loss on sale of $0.5 million was recognized immediately. Unamortized deferred gains related to these transactions were $98.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles, investments in non-consolidated equity method investees, and internal use software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company reviews internal management reports on a quarterly basis as well as monitors current and potential future competition in the markets where it operates for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate potential impairment of individual theatre assets. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The Company performs its impairment analysis quarterly. Under these analyses, if the sum of the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date for the fair value of Property, net. The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable existing renewal options will be exercised and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements. During calendar 2018, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $13.8 million on 13 theatres in the U.S. markets with 150 screens and 15 theatres with 118 screens in the international markets which was related to property, net. During calendar 2017, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $43.6 million on 12 theatres in the U.S. markets with 179 screens which was related to property, net. During calendar 2016, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million on two theatres in the U.S. markets with 22 screens, which was related to property, net. Foreign Currency Translation: Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and the Company’s £500.0 million, 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) are not included in net earnings. If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Income and Operating Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. The statement of operations effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance: The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $24.9 million and $28.1 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $25.1 million, of $22.1 million, and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income):

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. ASC 606 was applied only to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The comparative information in the prior year has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which was the accounting standard in effect for those periods. See Note 2 – Revenue Recognition for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers per the guidance in ASC 606. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. ASU 2018-02 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a reclassification related to the stranded tax effects that increased accumulated other comprehensive income and increased accumulated deficit by $5.0 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2018. See Note 17 – Accumulated other comprehensive income for further information. Modification Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (“ASU 2017-09”), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements and provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of the share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 on January 1, 2018 and will apply the guidance in ASU 2017-09 to any future changes to the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards should they occur. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Improving Presentation of Net Benefit Costs. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The guidance requires the service cost component of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from the services rendered by the pertinent employees while the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and reported outside a subtotal of operating income. The amendments in this guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018 and recorded a prior period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations to decrease general and administrative other by $0.2 million, related to the other components of net benefit cost, with a corresponding increase to other expense (income) and decrease to other income of $0.2 million, respectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-18”). ASU 2016-18 requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018 and the prior period has been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. This guidance also requires a new disclosure to reconcile the cash balances within the consolidated statement of cash flows to the consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows:

Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”). The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues. The update provides specific guidance on each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 and made an election to continue using the “nature of the distribution approach” to classify distributions received from equity method investments. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. Classification and measurement of financial instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 and recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to the unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities that are equity instruments with a corresponding decrease to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning of the year. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (“ASC 842”) which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (“ROU”) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application, whereby comparative prior period financial information and disclosures will not be adjusted to reflect the new standard. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases, which permits an entity to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under ASU 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASC 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases. ASC 842 provides several optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company expects to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements but does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. The Company also expects to elect the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases for leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company expects that this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. While the Company is finalizing the effect of adoption, the Company expects the most significant changes relate to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet for theatres currently subject to operating leases adjusted for the balances of prepaid rent, favorable lease assets and unfavorable lease liabilities, and deferred rent; (2) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain sale leaseback transactions (those arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements for which construction is complete and the Company is leasing the constructed asset) that currently do not qualify for sale accounting and the recognition of new ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on its balance sheet; (3) the derecognition of deferred gains from the sale and leaseback transactions; and (4) providing new disclosures about the Company’s leasing activities. On January 1, 2019, the Company expects to recognize additional operating lease liabilities ranging from an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion, with corresponding ROU assets based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments using preliminary estimates of discount rates for the Company’s existing operating leases. The Company has not finalized the effects of these expected changes from the new standard . Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance will impact how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and evaluates its available-for-sale investments for impairment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-13 will have on its fair value measurement disclosures. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other–Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation, setup, and other upfront costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the Company incurred acquisition-related and transition costs for Carmike of approximately $39.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively, which were included in general and administrative expense: merger, acquisition and transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Carmike was acquired on December 21, 2016 and the Company immediately began integrating the operations.

Department of Justice Final Judgment - In connection with the acquisition of Carmike the Company entered into a Final Judgment with the United States Department of Justice on March 7, 2017, pursuant to which the Company agreed to take certain actions to enable it to complete its acquisition of Carmike, including the divestiture of 17 movie theatres (and certain related assets) in the 15 local markets where the Company and Carmike are direct competitors to one or more acquirers acceptable to the DOJ (the Company received gross proceeds of $25.1 million related to divested theatre assets that were held for sale and sold during the year ended December 31, 2017); establish firewalls to ensure the Company does not obtain National CineMedia, LLC’s (“NCM LLC”), National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc” and collectively with NCM LLC “NCM”) Screenvision’s or other exhibitors competitively sensitive information; relinquish seats on NCM’s board of directors and all other NCM governance rights; and transfer 24 theatres comprising 384 screens (which represent less than 2% of NCM’s total network) to the Screenvision network. This includes five Carmike theatres that implemented the Screenvision network prior to completion of the Carmike acquisition, an AMC theatre required to extend its existing term with the Screenvision network, and an AMC theatre that was also included in the divestitures. The settlement agreement also requires the Company to divest the majority of its equity interests in NCM, so that by June 20, 2019, it owns no more than 4.99% of NCM’s outstanding equity interests on a fully converted basis. The Company sold 14,800,000 NCM, Inc. common shares during the year ended December 31, 2017 and has satisfied the DOJ divestiture requirements related to NCM for calendar 2017 as calculated pursuant to the Final Judgment. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the settlement, effective December 20, 2016, Craig R. Ramsey, executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, resigned his position as a member of the Board of Directors of NCM, Inc. On June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements with each of Regal and Cinemark pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million. The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, the Company no longer owns any shares of common stock in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5%. Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB On March 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) for cash.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed the indebtedness of Nordic of approximately SEK 1,269 million ($144.4 million) and indebtedness of approximately €156 million ($169.5 million) as of March 28, 2017, which was refinanced subsequent to the acquisition. The Company also assumed approximately SEK 13.5 million ($1.6 million) and approximately €1.0 million ($1.1 million) of interest rate swaps related to the indebtedness which were repaid following the acquisition. All amounts have been converted into US Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.11378 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0865, which were the exchange rates on March 27, 2017. The acquisition is being treated as a purchase in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. The allocation of purchase price is based on management’s judgment after evaluating several factors, including a valuation assessment. The Company finalized the appraisals for both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals, and market comparables. The purchase price paid by the Company in the acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill because it exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company paid a price in excess of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed because the acquisition of Nordic enhances its position as the largest movie exhibition company in Europe and broadens and diversifies its European platform. The Company also expects to realize synergy and cost savings related to the acquisition because of purchasing and procurement economies of scale. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company incurred acquisition-related and transition costs for Nordic of approximately $1.5 million and $10.1 million, which were included in general and administrative expense: merger, acquisition and transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Nordic was acquired on March 28, 2017 and the Company immediately began integrating the operations. The revenues for Nordic during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $374.1 million, and net earnings was $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Pro Forma Results of Operations (Unaudited) The following selected comparative unaudited actual results of operation information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the comparative unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 assumes that the Odeon, Carmike, and Nordic acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2016, and reflects the full results of operations for the years presented. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to indicate the results of operations which would actually have occurred had the combination been in effect on the dates indicated, or which may occur in the future. These amounts have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of Odeon, Carmike, and Nordic to reflect the fair value adjustments to property and equipment and financing obligations. The pro forma financial information presented includes the effects of adjustments related to preliminary values assigned to long-lived assets, including depreciation charges from acquired property and equipment, interest expense and incremental shares issued from financing the acquisitions and the related income tax effects and the elimination of Carmike and AMC historical revenues and expenses for theatres in markets that were divested as required by the Department of Justice. Merger, acquisition and transaction costs directly related to the acquisitions have not been removed.

============================================================

Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Buildings and improvements 5 to 45 years Leasehold improvements 1 to 20 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 1 to 11 years
============================================================

Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $498.2 million, $495.2 million, and $239.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

NOTE 6 – INVESTMENTS Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50% voting control, and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2018, include interests in DCIP of 29.0%, DCDC of 14.6%, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0%, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, 18.4% and DCM of 50.0%. The Company also has partnership interests in four U.S. motion picture theatres and one IMAX ® screen of 50.0% (“Theatre Partnerships”) and approximately 50.0% interest in 58 theatres in Europe acquired in the Odeon and Nordic acquisitions. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s recorded investments are greater than its proportional ownership of the underlying equity in its non-consolidated affiliates by approximately $40.0 million. Amounts payable to U.S. Theatre Partnerships were $0.9 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. RealD Inc. Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Issuance and Restrictions Agreement with RealD Holdings Inc. (“RealD”). The new agreement replaces a similar agreement with RealD for the lease of RealD 3D systems where rental payments continue to be variable and based on paid admissions and extends the term of the agreement to December 31, 2024. The investments are recorded at cost following the measurement alternative as there is no established market for the securities and the Company does not have significant influence over these entities. The Company sold 1,222,780 shares in RealD Inc. during the year ended December 31, 2016 and recognized a gain on sale of $3.0 million. Dreamscape and Central Services Studios Preferred Stock During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company invested $5.0 million in Dreamscape Immersive, Inc. and invested $5.0 million in Central Services Studios, Inc. as a part of its virtual reality technologies strategy. During January 2018, the Company invested an additional $5.0 million in Dreamscape and an additional $5.0 million in Central Services Studios. The Company does not have significant influence over these entities and will follow the cost method of accounting. NCM Transactions In March 2018, the NCM Common Unit Adjustment ("CUA") resulted in a negative adjustment of 915,150 common units for the Company. The Company elected to return the units and recorded the surrendered common units as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $5.2 million, based upon a price per share of NCM, Inc. of $5.64 on March 15, 2018. The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. On June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, the Company no longer owns any shares of common stock in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5%. The Company recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2% or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. The Company has a mortgage note payable to NCM in the amount of $1.3 million in current maturities of corporate borrowings and capital and finance lease obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, payments received of $5.4 million, $6.0 million, and $7.8 million, respectively, related to the NCM tax receivable agreement were recorded in investment expense (income), net of related amortization for the NCM tax receivable agreement intangible asset. SV Holdco. (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity. SV Holdco has elected to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 30, 2018, Screenvision entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision. The Company received distributions and merger consideration of $45.9 million on July 2, 2018 upon consummation of the Screenvision merger and retains a 18.4% common membership interest. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in Screenvision to $0 and recorded equity in earnings for the excess distribution of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5% per annum, compounded annually.

============================================================

On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 (the "Convertible Notes due 2024"). The Convertible Notes due 2024 mature on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2024 at 2.95% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on March 15, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to repurchase and retire 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock held by Wanda for $17.50 per share or approximately $421.0 million, associated legal fees of $2.6 million, and to pay a special dividend of $1.55 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, or approximately $160.5 million on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on September 25, 2018. The Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98% over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also recorded debt issuance costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company recorded interest expense for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this resulted in other income of $66.4 million. The principal balance exceeded the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2024 by approximately $211.2 million as of December 31, 2018 based on the closing price per share of our common stock of $12.28 per share. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are generally not convertible to equity in the first year after issuance. Upon conversion by a holder thereof, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 (which represents an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2018, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 would be convertible into 31,662,269 shares of Class A common stock. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, in the event that the then-applicable conversion price is greater than 120% of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten days prior to the second anniversary of issuance (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2024 is subject to a reset provision that would adjust the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision is subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30% of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. In addition, a trigger of the reset provision would result in up to 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda becoming subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The feature is contingent on the same reset of the conversion price which is part of the conversion feature. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature is not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 host and it is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this resulted in other income of $45.0 million. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than the special dividend referenced above and a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until the second anniversary of issuance and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2024 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the Convertible Notes due 2024) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024 for cash on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance at par if the price for the Company’s Class A common stock is equal to or greater than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for 20 or more trading days out of a consecutive 30 day trading period (including the final three trading days), at which time the holders have the option to convert. The Company also has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024, between the second and third anniversary of issuance, if the reset provision described above is triggered at a redemption price in cash that would result in the noteholders realizing a 15% IRR from the date of issuance regardless of when any particular noteholder acquired its Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also bifurcated this redemption feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and considered it as a part of the overall fair value of the derivative liability. With certain exceptions, upon a change of control of the Company or if the Company’s Class A common stock is not listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market, the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 may require that the Company repurchase in cash all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and limit the ability of the Company to incur liens with respect to the Company’s senior subordinated notes or any debt incurred to refinance the Company’s senior subordinated notes. The Indenture also includes customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 under the Indenture. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by all the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. On September 14, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) providing for, among other things, registration rights with respect to the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2024. Subject to the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC not later than three months from the issuance date of the Convertible Notes in order to provide for resales of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company filed a registration statement with the SEC on December 14, 2018 to fulfill this requirement. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders make available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £100.0 million ($126.8 million as of December 31, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, there were borrowings of £9.4 million ($11.9 million) outstanding and Odeon had £73.9 million ($93.7 million) available for borrowing, net £16.7 million ($21.2 million) letters of credit. The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the revolving credit facility is 2.5% plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee is 0.5% of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral. Bridge Loan Agreement On December 21, 2016, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Bridge Loan Agreement”). The Company borrowed $350.0 million of interim bridge loans (the “Interim Bridge Loans”) on December 21, 2016 under the Bridge Loan Agreement and recorded approximately $4.4 million in deferred financing costs. The proceeds of the Interim Bridge Loans were used to partially finance the acquisition of Carmike. On February 13, 2017, the Company repaid the aggregate principal amount of Interim Bridge Loans of $350.0 million with a portion of the proceeds from its public offering of shares of Holdings Class A common stock, as discussed in Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity. The Company recorded a loss of $0.4 million in other income, which included a write-off of deferred financing costs of $3.7 million, partially offset by a refund of fees of $3.3 million on the extinguishment of indebtedness related to the redemption of the interim bridge loan. Senior Secured Credit Facility The Senior Secured Credit Facility is with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for a Revolving Credit Facility, including a borrowing capacity which is available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice. Senior Secured Credit Facility. On April 30, 2013, the Company entered into a $925.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility pursuant to which the Company borrowed term loans and used the proceeds to fund the redemption of the former Senior Secured Credit Facility term loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was comprised of a $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matured on April 30, 2018 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), and a $775.0 million term loan, which matures on April 30, 2020 (the “Term Loan due 2020”). The Term Loan due 2020 required repayments of principal of 0.25% of the original principal amount, or $1.9 million, per quarter, with the remaining principal payable upon maturity. The term loan was issued at a 0.25% discount, which was amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The Company capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately $6.9 million related to the issuance of the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $2.2 million related to the issuance of the Term Loan due 2020. First Amendment. On December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a first amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013 (“First Amendment”). The First Amendment provides for the incurrence of $125.0 million incremental term loans (“Incremental Term Loan”). In addition, the First Amendment, among other things, (a) extends the maturity date with respect to (i) the existing Term Loan due 2020 and the Incremental Term Loan (together “Term Loan due 2022”) to December 15, 2022 and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility from April 30, 2018 to December 15, 2020 and (b) increases the applicable margin for the Term Loan due 2022 from 1.75% with respect to base rate borrowings to 2.25% and 2.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings to 3.25%. The Company capitalized additional deferred financing costs of approximately $6.5 million related to the modification of the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $3.3 million related to the modification of the term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used by the Company to pay expenses related to the First Amendment transactions and the Starplex Cinemas acquisition. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $1.4 million in other expense (income) during the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted of third-party costs, deferred financing costs, and discount write-off incurred in connection with the modification of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Second Amendment. On November 8, 2016, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013, as previously amended, to among other things, lower the applicable margin on base rate borrowings from 2.25% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on LIBOR borrowings from 3.25% to 2.75%, to reduce the minimum rate for base rate borrowings from 1.75% to 1.00% and the minimum rate for LIBOR rate borrowings to 0.0% and to allow for additional term loan borrowings of $500 million. On November 29, 2016, the Company borrowed $500.0 million additional Term loans due on December 15, 2023 (“Term Loan due 2023”). The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $18.8 million and a discount of 0.25%, or $1.3 million, related to the Term Loan due 2023. The Company used the net proceeds from the Term Loan due 2023 to pay the consideration for the Odeon acquisition and the related refinancing of Odeon debt assumed in the acquisition. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s option, either a base rate or LIBOR. The minimum rate for base rate borrowings is 1.00% and the minimum rate for LIBOR-based borrowings is 0%. The applicable margin for the Terms loan due 2022 and 2023 is 2.00% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR based loans. The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.5% for base rate borrowings and from 2.25% to 2.5% for LIBOR based borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee of 0.50% per annum and for letter of credit fees of up to 0.25% per annum plus the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings on the undrawn amount of the letter of credit. The applicable rate for borrowings under the Term Loans due 2022 and 2023 at December 31, 2017 were each 3.727% based on LIBOR (2.75% margin plus 0% minimum LIBOR rate). The Term Loans due 2022 and 2023 requires repayments of principal of 0.25% of the original principal amount, or $3.5 million per quarter, with any remaining balance due on December 15, 2022 or December 15, 2023, as applicable. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans and (ii) in connection with a repricing transaction closed (a) in respect of the Term Loans due 2022, within six months from the date the Second Amendment becomes effective or (b) in respect of the Term Loans due 2023, within six months from the date on which the available commitments of the relevant lenders in respect of the Term Loans due 2023 are reduced to zero, in which case the Company must pay a 1% premium on the amount of Term Loans repaid. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, to sell assets; incur additional indebtedness; prepay other indebtedness (including the notes); pay dividends and distributions or repurchase their capital stock; create liens on assets; make investments; make acquisitions; engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in transactions with affiliates; amend constituent documents and material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, including the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022, the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025; the 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, and the 5.875 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024; change the business conducted by it and its subsidiaries; and enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain, on the last day of each fiscal quarter, a net senior secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, of no more than 3.25 to 1 as long as the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility remain outstanding. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of (i) a change in control, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, (ii) defaults under other indebtedness of the Company, any guarantor or any significant subsidiary having a principal amount of $25.0 million or more, and (iii) one or more uninsured judgments against the Company, any guarantor, or any significant subsidiary for an aggregate amount exceeding $25.0 million with respect to which enforcement proceedings are brought or a stay of enforcement is not in effect for any period of 60 consecutive days. Third Amendment. On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the Third Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Third Amendment decreased the applicable margin for the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement from 1.75% to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.75% to 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The Company expensed $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 for third-party fees related to the Third Amendment to the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On June 13, 2017, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Fourth Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving loan commitment under the Credit Agreement from $150.0 million to $225.0 million. Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On August 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc, as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Fifth Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Fifth Amendment made certain changes to certain covenants and definitions. These amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement were executed in order to facilitate an internal reorganization due to recent tax changes and to make modifications which clarified certain ambiguities in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. The cash flows for the term loans due 2022 and 2023 were not changed as a result of the August 14, 2018 modification and the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement was not changed. As a result, the Company has accounted for the Fifth Amendment as a modification. The Company expensed $0.3 million of third-party costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 and capitalized $1.5 million debt issuance costs for amounts paid to lenders. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations (as well as cash management obligations), are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets as well as those of each subsidiary guarantor.

Interest is payable on the Senior Secured Notes due 2023 on June 15th and December 15th of each year beginning. The Company recorded the debt at estimated fair value of $242.1 million based on a closing price for the Senior Secured Notes due 2023 of 105.25 on December 21, 2016. Pursuant to a supplemental indenture, dated as of February 17, 2017, among AMC, Carmike, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee to the indenture, dated as of June 17, 2015, providing for the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, the Company agreed to provide a guarantee of Carmike’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes due 2023.

The Company pays interest on the Notes due 2022 at 5.875% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on February 15th and August 15th, commencing on August 15, 2014.

The Notes due 2022 are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several unsecured senior subordinated basis by all of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. The indenture governing the Notes due 2022 contains covenants limiting other indebtedness, dividends, purchases or redemptions of stock, transactions with affiliates and mergers and sales of assets. The Company filed a registration statement on April 1, 2014 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to an offer to exchange the original Notes due 2022 for exchange Notes due 2022.

On September 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Silver Lake Alpine, L.P., an affiliate of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (“Silver Lake”), relating to the issuance to Silver Lake (or its designated affiliates) of $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024. See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings - Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 for more information. On September 14, 2018, the Company, Silver Lake and Wanda entered into a Right of First Refusal Agreement (the “ ROFR Agreement ”), which provides Silver Lake certain rights to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock that Wanda proposes to sell during a period of two years from the date of execution of the ROFR Agreement or, if earlier, until such time that Wanda and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 50.1% of the total voting power of the Company’s voting stock. The right of first refusal applies to both registered and unregistered transfers of shares. Under the ROFR Agreement, in the event that Wanda and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 50.1% of the total voting power of the Company’s voting stock, then the Company will have the same right of first refusal over sales of the Company’s common stock by Wanda as described above until the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date of execution of the ROFR Agreement. In such event, the Company may exercise such right to purchase shares from Wanda from time to time pursuant to the ROFR Agreement in its sole discretion, subject to approval by the disinterested directors of the Board. If the Company determines to exercise its right to purchase shares from Wanda pursuant to the ROFR Agreement, it will have the obligation under the Investment Agreement to offer to sell to Silver Lake a like number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the same per share price at which it purchased the Wanda shares. On September 14, 2018, the Company used the proceeds from the Convertible Notes due 2024, and pursuant to a stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda, repurchased 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock at a price of $17.50 per share or $421.0 million and associated legal fees of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, Wanda owns 50.01% of AMC through its 51,769,784 shares of Class B common stock. With the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda retains voting control of AMC with 75.01% of the voting power of the Company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 8 up to 5,666,000 shares of Class B common stock are subject to forfeiture for no consideration in connection with the reset provision contained in the Indenture. Temporary Equity Certain members of management have the right to require Holdings to repurchase the Class A common stock held by them under certain limited circumstances pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement. Beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on January 1, 2019 (or upon the termination of a management stockholders employment by the Company without cause, by the management stockholder for good reason, or due to the management stockholders death or disability) management stockholders will have the right, in limited circumstances, to require Holdings to purchase shares that are not fully and freely tradeable at a price equal to the price per share paid by such management stockholder with appropriate adjustments for any subsequent events such as dividends, splits, or combinations. The shares of Class A common stock subject to the stockholder agreement are classified as temporary equity, apart from permanent equity, as a result of the contingent redemption feature contained in the stockholder agreement. The Company determined the amount reflected in temporary equity for the Class A common stock-based on the price paid per share by the management stockholders and Wanda on August 30, 2012, the date Wanda acquired Holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one former employee and one current employee who held a total of 37,105 shares relinquished their put rights, therefore the related share amount of $0.4 million was reclassified to additional paid in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a former employee who held 27,197 shares, relinquished his put right, therefore the related amount of $0.3 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2016, a former employee who held 27,197 shares, relinquished his put right, therefore the related amount of $0.2 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. The stockholders agreement for certain members of management ended on January 1, 2019 and the contingent redemption feature will no longer be operative in calendar 2019. Additional Public Offering On February 13, 2017, the Company completed an additional public offering of 20,330,874 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.50 per share ($640.4 million), resulting in net proceeds of $616.8 million after underwriters commission and other professional fees.

Treasury Stock On August 3, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a $100.0 million share repurchase program to repurchase its Class A common stock over a two-year period. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time through open-market transactions including block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise until mid-August 2019 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. The extent to which AMC repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including liquidity, capital needs of the business, market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations, as determined by AMC’s management team. Repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company’s management might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any minimum dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $8.2 million.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. On the basis of this evaluation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, a valuation allowance of $221.6 million was established domestically on the Company’s net deferred tax assets and considering indefinite-lived intangibles. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income is reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company maintained its valuation allowance. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, limiting the amount of deductible interest expense, limiting executive compensations, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance at December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $121.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is comprised of $88.6 million of deferred tax expense associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, as reflected in the rate reconciliation, and $210.4 million of deferred tax benefit associated with the partial release of the Company’s valuation allowance as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has assessed the deemed mandatory repatriation provisions of the Tax Reform Act, and is projecting no impact to current year domestic taxable income as it relates to undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company does not intend to distribute earnings in a taxable manner, and therefore intends to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the 100 percent dividends received deduction provided for in the Tax Reform Act, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes. As a result, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. While the Tax Reform Act provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Income tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components:

The Company generated alternative minimum taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, which fully offset the taxes due to the utilization of tax credits. Under the Tax Reform Act, alternative minimum tax credit will be refundable in the future. The Company has reclassed the alternative minimum tax credits from deferred tax assets to a long-term tax receivable. Pre-tax income (losses) consisted of the following:

The Company’s federal income tax loss carryforward of $212.8 million will begin to expire in 2019 and will completely expire in 2036 and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $652.6 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $6.8 million, which will expire in various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $243.5 million, which may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years. A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company determined it is not necessary to accrue interest and penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $15.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively. There are currently, unrecognized tax benefits which the Company anticipates will be resolved in the next 12 months; however, the Company is unable at this time to estimate what the impact on its unrecognized tax benefits will be. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after March 28, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2000, through December 31, 2017, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 12 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans generally covering all employees in the U.S. who, prior to the freeze, were age 21 or older and had completed at least 1,000 hours of service in their first year of employment, or in a calendar year ending thereafter, and who were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company sponsors frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. that were acquired from Odeon on November 30, 2016. The Company sponsors a frozen defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that was acquired from Nordic on March 28, 2017. The Company also offered eligible retirees the opportunity to participate in a health plan. Certain employees were eligible for subsidized postretirement medical benefits. The eligibility for these benefits was based upon a participant’s age and service as of January 1, 2009. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan. The measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefits were December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets’ historical returns, asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management’s best estimate of the long-term prospective return. Cash Flows The Company expects to contribute $4.1 million and $0.0 million to the U.S. and International pension plans, respectively during the calendar year 2019. The following table provides the benefits expected to be paid (inclusive of benefits attributable to estimated future employee service) in each of the next five years, and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter:

Pension Plan Assets The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. The target allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plan The Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, the Company matches 100% of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3% and 50% of contributions up to 5% of the employee’s eligible compensation. The Company’s expense under the 401(k) savings plan was $5.3 million, $4.4 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Iron workers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, asserted claims under some or all of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions and appointed the International Union of Operating Engineers Pension Fund of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as lead plaintiff. On August 13, 2018, lead plaintiff and additional named plaintiff Hawaii Structural Iron Workers Pension Trust Fund (“Plaintiffs”) filed an Amended Class Action Complaint. On November 21, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On August 27, 2018, defendants and the Company as nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On September 17, 2018, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. Due to the variety of remedies available, the Company believes that if the current tenant defaulted on the leases it would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 14 – THEATRE AND OTHER CLOSURE AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS The Company has provided reserves for estimated losses from theatres and screens which have been permanently closed and vacant space with no right to future use. As of December 31, 2018, the Company reserved $18.1 million for lease terminations which have either not been consummated or paid, related primarily to nine theatres and certain vacant restaurant space. The Company is obligated under long-term lease commitments with remaining terms of up to 10 years for theatres which have been closed. As of December 31, 2018, base rents aggregated approximately $5.9 million annually and $18.8 million over the remaining terms of the leases. A rollforward of reserves for theatre and other closure is as follows:

The Company recognized theatre and other closure expense of $2.7 million, $3.0 million, and $5.2 million, during the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Theatre and other closure expense included the accretion on previously closed properties with remaining lease obligations. In the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, the current portion of the theatre and other closure ending balance of $5.6 million was included with accrued expenses and other liabilities and the long-term portion of the theatre and other closure ending balance of $12.5 million was included with other long-term liabilities. See Note 7 – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information for further information. Theatre and other closure reserves for leases that have not been terminated were recorded at the present value of the future contractual commitments for the base rents, taxes and maintenance. As of December 31, 2018, the future lease obligations are discounted at annual rates ranging from 6.0% to 9.0%. NOTE 15 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:

============================================================

============================================================
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

============================================================

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. The equity securities, available-for-sale, primarily consist of common stock and mutual funds invested in equity, fixed income, and international funds and are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. See Note 17 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the unrealized gain on equity securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

============================================================

Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for level 2 inputs. The level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these Convertible Notes. The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings for further information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. NOTE 16 – OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. Beginning with the Company’s acquisition of Odeon in 2016, the Company has identified two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segments consist of two operating segments (Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres) with operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Denmark. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The two international operating segments, Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres, are combined into one reportable segment (International markets) because they have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria described in the accounting guidance for segment reporting. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment:

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision, (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in international markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

(4) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from minority equity investments in theatre operators in certain international markets. See below for a reconciliation of the Company’s equity earnings of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where the Company holds a significant market share, the Company believes attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments. The Company also provides services to these theatre operators including information technology systems, certain on-screen advertising services and our gift card and package ticket program. As these investments relate only to the Company’s Nordic acquisition, the second quarter of 2017 represents the first time the Company has made this adjustment and does not impact prior historical presentations of Adjusted EBITDA.

NOTE 18 – EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of unvested RSU’s with a service condition only and unvested contingently issuable RSUs that have service and performance conditions, if dilutive, as well as potential dilutive shares from the conversion feature of the Convertible Notes due 2024, if dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share:

============================================================

Vested RSUs and PSU’s have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs are subject to performance conditions and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. During the year ended December 31, 2018 unvested PSUs of 364,269 at the minimum performance target were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period and unvested RSU’s of 210,558 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or they would be anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2017 unvested PSUs and Transition PSUs of 187,468 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 88,194 were not included in the computation of diluted loss because they would anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2016, unvested PSUs of 83,477 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 90,654 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as vesting conditions were not met at the end of the reporting period. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes due 2024 that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has adjusted net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 to eliminate the interest expense and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $9.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects are dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $18.95 per share the Convertible Notes due 2024 are convertible into 31,662,269 Class A common shares.

(1) In the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, the Company recorded the impact of the change in the U.S. enacted federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% which reduced its deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter and in connection with the preparation of its 2017 consolidated financial statements, the Company also determined that realization of its deferred tax assets in the U.S. tax jurisdictions was not more likely than not, primarily as a result of cumulative net losses recorded for three years and the Company recorded a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in U.S. tax jurisdictions. As a result of the change in enacted tax rate and recording a full valuation allowance for the Company’s deferred tax assets in U.S. tax jurisdictions, the Company recorded a charge to its income tax provision in the fourth quarter of approximately $310.0 million.

Independent Auditor's Report The Members Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, members' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ CohnReznick LLP Roseland, New Jersey February 18, 2019 DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ($in thousands)

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Nature of Operations Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, ("DCIP", and together with its consolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, the "Company") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 12, 2007 for the purpose of raising third-party capital to purchase and deploy digital cinema projection equipment ("Digital Systems") in theatres located throughout the United States and Canada. The Company will continue in perpetuity. The Company is headquartered in New Jersey and has offices in Colorado and Minnesota. The Company is owned by its founding members American Multi-Cinema, Inc. ("AMC"), Cinemark Media, Inc. ("Cinemark") and Regal/DCIP Holdings, LLC ("Regal") (collectively, the "Founding Members"). On March 10, 2010, the Company completed an initial financing transaction for the deployment of Digital Systems utilizing its subsidiary entities Kasima, LLC ("Kasima"), Kasima Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") and Kasima Parent Holdings, LLC ("Parent") to execute its business plan. Kasima is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Parent is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DCIP. As part of the initial financing transaction, Parent entered into a note purchase agreement with a third-party investment fund. On March 31, 2011, the Company obtained the incremental financing necessary to complete its planned deployment of Digital Systems and on May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced all of its outstanding senior secured debt, extending the term of that debt and lowering its effective interest rate. On March 31, 2014, Parent repaid, in full, the outstanding notes under the note purchase agreement. Digital Systems are purchased by Kasima and leased to each Founding Member or one of its affiliates (each such entity, an "Exhibitor") pursuant to the terms of a Master Equipment Lease Agreement ("ELA"). Kasima facilitates the installation of the leased Digital Systems into each Exhibitor's theatres pursuant to the terms of an Installation Agreement. The Exhibitor is responsible for the ongoing maintenance and insurance of the Digital Systems. The Company has also entered into (and assigned to Kasima) long-term Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements ("DCDAs") with six major motion picture studios ("Major Studios") pursuant to which Kasima receives a virtual print fee ("VPF") each time the studio books a film or certain other content on the Digital Systems. Other content distributors have entered into DCDAs or shorter term agreements with the Company that provide for the payment of VPFs (or as more fully described and defined in Note 2, alternative content fees or "ACFs") to Kasima for bookings of the distributor's content on a Digital System. One such distributor, AC JV, LLC ("Fathom Events"), is related to DCIP through common ownership. On June 20, 2011, DCIP and Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership ("CDCP") entered into a long-term management services agreement (an "MSA" and with respect to CDCP, the "CDCP MSA") to manage a similar deployment of Digital Systems in Canada and to perform certain other specified services for CDCP related thereto (see Note 2). CDCP is a Canadian limited partnership formed by Cineplex Entertainment LP ("Cineplex") and Empire Theatres Ltd. ("Empire") to facilitate the purchase and deployment of Digital Systems to their theatres in Canada. On April 1, 2012, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Cinemark USA, Inc., a Texas corporation and an affiliate of Cinemark, to manage deployment of Digital Systems to theatres operated by its affiliates in Latin America (the "CNI MSA"). On September 1, 2014, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Fathom Events to provide it with management and software related services. The services we provide under this agreement have changed from time to time. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DCIP and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. New accounting standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This update is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgements and changes in judgements and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the new standard and related updates on January 1, 2018 and used the modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company reviewed the terms and conditions of its existing customer contracts and applied the five discrete criteria required for recognizing revenue as set forth in ASU 2014-09. Based upon its analysis, the new revenue recognition guidance had no significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not expect this new standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. This guidance requires entities to include in its cash and cash equivalent balances any amounts that are deemed restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this standard retrospectively on January 1, 2018. In August 2017, the FASB amended the requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments will be effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to depreciation and recoverability of property and equipment, amortization, the valuation of derivative agreements and the reimbursement liability concerning equipment warranty and replacement costs under the ELAs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments and consists primarily of money market funds and other overnight investments. The Company maintains bank accounts with major banks, which from time to time may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. Concentration of credit risk For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had three customers that represented 33% and 34%, respectively, of operating revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had four customers that represented 44% of operating revenues. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, four and three customers represented 55% and 39%, respectively, of net accounts receivable. These customers are each parties to DCDAs. None of the Company's other customers individually represented more than 10% of operating revenues or accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 or 2017, or for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable, which consists primarily of amounts owed by the Major Studios and other digital content distributors. The Company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit losses. During 2018, the Company incurred bad debt expense of $4,198,000 related primarily to two studio bankruptcies. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, management has determined that there is no requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Concentration in foreign countries The Company originally leased Digital Systems to AMC (pursuant to its ELA) for theatres located in Canada and receives revenues from CDCP pursuant to the CDCP MSA. In 2013, AMC sold the last of its Canadian theatres and, as a result, the Company no longer leases Digital Systems to AMC in Canada. The revenue previously earned from these operations was paid to the Company in U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenues earned from Canadian sources totaled $1,812,000, $1,799,000 and $1,812,000, respectively. The carrying value of equipment deployed in Canada at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was zero. Revenue earned by the Company under the CNI MSA for theatres located in Latin America was $722,000, $818,000 and $825,000, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fair value and credit risk All current assets and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. The Company's Credit Facility (see Note 7) is comprised of floating rate instruments and management believes fair value approximates carrying value. Property and equipment, net Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Computer equipment and software 3-5 years Leasehold improvements 5 years Digital cinema projection equipment 17.5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years
============================================================

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Costs for general and administrative expenses, overhead, maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems, are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or other disposition of any property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposal is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Deferred financing costs, net Deferred financing costs are amortized on the interest method basis for the Credit Facility as described in Note 7 and by a charge to interest expense over the term of the Credit Facility and reported as a reduction of long-term debt, net. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $11,713,000 and $10,828,000, respectively. Fair value measurements The Company accounts for and reports the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company applies fair value accounting for financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"): Level 1 :Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 :Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3 :Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions. The following table sets forth, by level, the fair value measurements of the Company's consolidated financial assets ($in thousands): Fair Value Measurements

============================================================
December 31, Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair value of Interest Rate Swap $472 (1) $- $472 $- (1) Reported in derivative assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
============================================================

The fair value of the Company's assets under its Interest Rate Swap (as defined below) is based upon observable market-based inputs that reflect the present values of the difference between estimated future fixed rate payments and future variable receipts and, therefore, is classified within Level 2. The Level 2 fair value of the Company's Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2017 was $1,279,000. Accounting for derivatives In May 2013, the Company terminated an existing swap arrangement and executed new interest rate swap agreements (the "Interest Rate Swap"). Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a component of members' equity) or in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or fair value. The Company determined that the Interest Rate Swap was an effective cash flow hedging instrument through December 31, 2017 and, as a result, changes in the fair value of the Interest Rate Swap are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). During 2018, a portion of the hedge was designated as ineffective and an immaterial amount was recognized as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income taxes The Company is a limited liability company and, as such, is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, as a partnership for tax purposes, the Company is not a taxable entity for federal income taxes and is not subject to significant state income taxes. However, the Company does pay certain state taxes based on revenue or net income that are reported as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income or loss of the Company as a limited liability company is reported to and included in the individual income tax returns of its members. Tax years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities with regard to the allocation of income or losses by the Company to its members. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or conditions exist that indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for recoverability is based primarily on the Company's ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If the total of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the total carrying value of an asset, the asset is deemed not to be recoverable and possibly impaired. The Company then estimates the fair value of the asset to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the expected future discounted cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Revenue recognition The Company has analyzed the provisions of the FASB's ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and has concluded that no changes are necessary to conform with the new standard. The majority of the Company's revenues are VPFs from Major Studios under the DCDAs. The Company earns VPF revenue when movies and certain other content distributed by Major Studios and other content distributors are booked and exhibited on screens utilizing the Company's Digital Systems. VPFs are earned and payable based on a fee schedule outlined in the DCDAs and other VPF agreements. The VPF revenue is recognized in the period in which it is earned, generally the first time the content is booked and exhibited in the theatre auditorium for which a Digital System has been installed. The DCDAs with the Major Studios require the payment of VPFs for a period that ends on the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" for all Digital Systems scheduled to be deployed over a period of up to five years, or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. Cost recoupment occurs when revenues attributable to the Digital Systems exceed the costs associated with their purchase (including financing), deployment, administration and other allowed amounts, all as defined in the DCDAs. In addition to VPF revenue, the Company also earns a fee each time certain digital content other than feature films (e.g., concerts, sporting events and opera performances) is booked and exhibited on a Digital System. The Company refers to fees derived on a per-exhibition basis from these alternative forms of digital content as alternative content fees ("ACFs"). ACFs may be paid by the distributor of the alternative content pursuant to an agreement with the Company or by the Exhibitor showing the content pursuant to its ELA. ACF revenue is recognized in the period in which the alternative content is exhibited. Lease revenues in respect of the Digital Systems and certain other rental and usage fees are earned by the Company in accordance with the terms of the ELAs. All amounts due to the Company under these agreements are recognized as revenue when earned and any unearned amounts are recorded as deferred revenue. The initial lease term for each piece of equipment deployed under the ELAs begins on the date the equipment is placed in service and continues for 12 years, with the first and last month incurring one-half of the monthly lease payment otherwise due. The Company generates multiple revenue streams from the leased Digital Systems under the ELAs as follows: Lease fees are payable by the Exhibitors monthly and prior to March 31, 2014 were comprised of a fixed base lease rate plus a "step-up" rate component for all equipment (regardless of lease commencement date) that was to occur on October 1, 2016. The Company recognized lease revenue from these fees on a straight-line method making an allowance for the step-up in rent that was to occur. On March 31, 2014, the ELAs were amended to remove the scheduled step-up lease payments. The accumulated effects of the amendments are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction in revenue over the remaining terms of the ELAs. Contingent rent may be due under the ELAs if total revenues in respect of the Digital Systems deployed thereunder (calculated quarterly on a rolling last twelve-month basis) fail to meet certain minimum revenue thresholds. The minimum revenue thresholds were prorated for the initial four quarters of the ELAs. Contingent rent, if any, is calculated and recognized monthly, but billed and paid quarterly. No Contingent rent was due for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Peak period payments are due under the ELAs when the leased Digital Systems are taken out of service by an Exhibitor for one or more consecutive defined "peak periods" (generally a weekend) as a result of relocation, damage or a complex closing. Peak period payments, if any, are recognized, billed and paid monthly. In accordance with the ELAs, the Exhibitors are required to acquire extended warranties with respect to the leased Digital Systems covering the period from the expiration of the initial included manufacturer's warranty through the date of repayment of the Credit Facility (the "Warranty End Date"), but in no event later than 12 years from the effective date of the ELAs. Following the Warranty End Date, the Exhibitors may choose to continue extended warranty coverage through the expiration of the DCDAs (the "DCDA End Date"). The DCDA End Date will occur on the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" of the Digital Systems or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. The Company expects that the Exhibitors will maintain extended warranty coverage through the DCDA End Date. Pursuant to the ELAs, the Company is required to reimburse the Exhibitor for the costs of the extended warranties (and/or equipment replacement costs) subject to quarterly caps set forth in the ELAs. This contractual obligation by the Company to incur costs at a future date for the extended warranties or replacement costs when the leased equipment is purchased creates a liability at the purchase date and a contra revenue adjustment in respect of revenues derived under the ELAs that is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company also earns revenues in respect of the services DCIP provides under the MSAs. The revenues are earned ratably as the services are performed under the agreement. Subsequent events The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 18, 2019, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Note 3 - Financing Transactions On May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced its then outstanding senior secured debt, extending its term and lowering its effective interest rate. The transaction consisted of a $755,000,000 senior secured loan commitment (the Credit Facility described in Note 7) to Kasima from a group of commercial banks and institutional investors. Note 4 - Consolidated Balance Sheet Components Restricted cash The Company had restricted cash of $3,702,000 and $5,891,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in the form of an interest reserve escrow account related to the Credit Facility (see Note 7) and an excess cost escrow account for the funding of Digital Systems in excess of costs caps established in the related credit agreement.

Revenues earned under the ELAs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $20,409,000, $20,629,000 and $19,699,000, respectively . Note 7- Long-term Debt, net Credit facilities On May 17, 2013, DCIP, Holdings and Kasima entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC as Administrative Agent and a group of lenders which agreed to provide Kasima a $75 million revolving line of credit ("Revolver") and a $680 million term loan ("Term Loan B" and together with the Revolver, the "Credit Facility"). The Term Loan B was fully funded at the closing of the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Term Loan B were used to repay all amounts under the then outstanding credit facility and to repay fees, transaction costs and other expenses incurred in connection with such repayment and the establishment of the Credit Facility. All costs of Digital Systems exceeding established caps must be funded by capital contributions from the Founding Members. The Revolver was available, subject to certain conditions, through May 17, 2018, its maturity date, at which time no amounts were outstanding. The maturity date of the Term Loan B is May 17, 2021 (the "Term Loan B Maturity Date"). At December 31, 2017, the Revolver was undrawn. The Term Loan B borrowings bear interest, at the option of Kasima, at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate, each as defined in the Credit Facility, plus the defined Applicable Rate, which is 1.50% in the case of borrowings based on the Alternate Base Rate and 2.50% for borrowings based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate. The Term Loan B is further subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 0.75%. The commitment fee on undrawn amounts in respect of the Revolver was 0.50% per annum through its maturity date. The Term Loan B amortizes at 1.25% of its original principal amount per annum, payable in quarterly increments of $8.5 million commencing on September 30, 2014 with the remaining balance, including any unpaid interest and fees, payable on the Term Loan B Maturity Date. Prepayments of the Term Loan B reduce future mandatory amortization payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Commencing with the defined Test Date in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and annually on each Test Date thereafter, Kasima will prepay Term Loan B borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of defined Excess Cash Flow (generally the amount by which Cash Flow from Operations exceeds Consolidated Fixed Charges, each as defined, for the prior fiscal year). Kasima may at any time terminate or permanently reduce commitments under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty in $5 million increments of not less than $20 million. The "Borrower" under the Credit Facility is Kasima and the Credit Facility is guaranteed by Holdings and each direct or indirect subsidiary of Holdings other than the Borrower. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets of the Company (with certain negotiated exclusions), including contract rights, cash and securities accounts and the Digital Systems on Exhibitors' premises. Under the Credit Facility, the Borrower is required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. Material covenants included an interest coverage ratio, minimum average revenues per deployed screen, capital expenditure limitations and excess cash flow. At December 31, 2018, the Company had excess cash flow of $3.4 million which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2018, the Borrower was in compliance with all of its Credit Facility covenants. On September 27, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended to allow Kasima to make up to $20.0 million in distributions each fiscal year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including having revenue per average screen of no less than $12,475 for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period prior to any such distribution. As part of the same amendment, the Revolver was reduced from $75.0 million to $35.0 million. Following the effective date of the amendment in 2016, Kasima is making an annual distribution of $20.0 million to its member. The Company's long-term debt consists of the Term Loan B with balances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $70.0 million and $195.0 million, respectively, and interest rates of 5.26% and 4.17%, respectively.

Derivatives The Interest Rate Swap contracts were entered into for interest expense cost protection from rising variable interest rates and are associated with the Company's Term Loan B which matures on May 17, 2021. Under the Interest Rate Swap contracts, the Company receives current market LIBO Rate interest payments, subject to an interest rate floor for the Term Loan B of 0.75% per annum, and pays a fixed rate of 1.29% calculated on the same notional principal amount (the "Notional Swap Amount") which changes for each fiscal quarter commencing as of the quarter ended June 30, 2013 and terminating on the contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. The Notional Swap Amount for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2018 was $68,127,000 and the then-current market LIBO Rate interest was (1.52%) per annum. The protection afforded by the Interest Rate Swap extends until December 31, 2019 and the Notional Swap Amount decreases quarterly beginning September 30, 2014. Note 8 - Retirement Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for eligible employees under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
