​ ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Kansas City, Missouri February 27, 20 20 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Accounting Principles As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases . As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition of revenue and certain costs as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.

​ ​ See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ​ ​ AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 201 7 ​ NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. As of December 31, 2019, Wanda owned approximately 49.85 % of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 74.89 % of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, all of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to controlling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. Theatres and International Theatres. Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recognized at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100 % of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 12 % to 18 % of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Prior to January 1, 2018, income for non-redeemed exchange tickets were recognized 18 months after purchase when the redemption of these items was determined to be remote. At January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets to the proportional method, where it applies a non-redemption rate of 10 % to the current month sales, and the Company recognizes the total amount of income for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. Management believes the 24-month estimate is supported by its continued development of redemption history and that it is reflective of management’s current best estimate. The adoption of the proportional method of recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded online ticket fee revenues net of third-party commission or service fees. In accordance with ASC 606 guidance, the Company believes that it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. These changes did not have any impact on net income or cash flows from operations. Film Exhibition Costs. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded film payables of $166.5 million and $168.6 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Food and Beverage Costs. The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement. The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”) with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 — Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5 % to 8.5 %, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect transition adjustment of initially applying ASC 606 by increasing accumulated deficit on January 1, 2018 by approximately $52.9 million, including income tax effect of $0 , as a result of this change. These changes did not have any impact on the Company’s cash flows from operations. Customer Engagement Programs. AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program for the U.S. market which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs ® Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. Once an AMC Stubs Premiere TM or AMC Stubs Insider TM member accumulates 5,000 points they will earn a $5.00 virtual reward. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. Converted rewards not redeemed within nine months are forfeited and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. Prior to January 1, 2018, rewards for expired memberships were forfeited based upon specified periods of inactivity of the membership and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. As of January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing forfeited rewards from the remote method to the proportional method, where the Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. On June 20, 2018, the Company announced the launch of AMC Stubs ® A-List, a new tier of the AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests a unique subscription pricing structure for admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies for the monthly price of between $19.95 and $23.95 depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $42.6 million, $45.4 million, and $39.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents. All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability. The Company remeasures the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B common stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other expense (income) related to its derivative asset fair value of $17.7 million and $(45.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and other expense (income) related to its derivative liability fair value of $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations, Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity and Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for further discussions. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets were recorded at fair value for intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to theatre leases acquired under favorable terms, management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. Favorable leases that were previously classified as intangible assets were reclassified as an addition to the opening right-of-use (“ROU”) asset balances, as a result of adopting ASC 842, Leases, (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. As a result, there were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Investments. The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment income. Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 — Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2019, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.2 % interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50.0 % interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0 % interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6 % interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 10.0 % interest in Saudi Cinema Company LLC (“SCC”); a 50 % ownership interest in four U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50 % ownership interest in 55 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company had three reporting units, Domestic Theatres, Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company combined the Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres into a single reporting unit, International Theatres, to reflect how the international business is now managed. The Company tested goodwill for impairment both prior to and subsequent to the combining of these reporting units into the single reporting unit. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $4,789.1 million and $4,788.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in the common stock price and the resulting impact on market capitalization is one of several factors considered when making this evaluation. Based on recent sustained declines in the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2019. In performing the annual impairment test, the Company has an option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than the carrying values. Otherwise, the Company must perform a quantitative impairment test. The impairment test for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units, as compared to an equity value approach used previously. This change in estimate is preferable due to the impact of the change in the capital structure of the Domestic Theatres reporting unit late in the third quarter of 2018 as a result of the issuance of $600 million of the Company’s Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, the negative equity value carrying amount for the Domestic Theatres reporting unit, and the decline in the market capitalization since May 2019, which has increased the Company’s leverage ratio. See additional discussion in Note 6 — Corporate Borrowings. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 9.9 % and 11.8 %, respectively. Accordingly, there was no goodwill impairment recorded as of September 30, 2019. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of December 31, 2019. Given the further decline in the Company’s stock price during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its two reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts as of December 31, 2019. The Company compared its projected financial information and assumptions utilized in the quantitative analysis as of September 30, 2019 to the fourth quarter results noting operating performance is consistent with the projections and there have been no other changes which would impact management’s conclusion that the fair values of its reporting units exceed their carrying values. The Company also observed that its estimated fair value of its corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations remained relatively consistent from September 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019, which represents approximately 80 % of the Company’s market enterprise value. The Company observed higher enterprise value control premiums for a recent acquisition agreement in its industry than those utilized for the market approach. In considering the totality of the aforementioned factors together with the excess of fair value over carrying value calculated in both its reporting units in the previous impairment test, the Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its two reporting units have been reduced below their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company concluded that an interim quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2019 was not required. The Domestic Theatres reporting unit to which $3.1 billion of goodwill is allocated had a negative equity value carrying amount as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the Company assessed qualitative factors for both of its reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore no impairment charge was incurred. In addition, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of calendar 2018 and the third quarter and fourth quarter of calendar 2017. In all of these impairment tests, the Company reached a determination that there was no goodwill impairment. Other Long-term Assets. Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 — Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable. Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $40.9 million and $42.6 million, respectively. Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 or as of December 31, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years , with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years . The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years , which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of digital projectors and food and beverage equipment. As a result of adopting ASC 842, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes additional operating lease ROU assets and total operating lease liabilities of $4,796.0 million and $5,499.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The difference between the lease ROU assets and total lease liabilities upon initial measurement at January 1, 2019 was primarily due to the reclassification of: (i) deferred rent, landlord allowances, unfavorable lease balances, and theatre closure liabilities previously recorded in other long-term liabilities; (ii) current portions of theatre closure liabilities previously recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities; (iii) favorable lease balances previously recorded in intangible assets; and, (iv) prepaid rents recorded in other current assets within the consolidated balance sheets as an offset or addition to the opening lease ROU asset balances, as required by ASC 842. Sale Leaseback Transactions. Prior to adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the Company deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions and amortized the gains over the remaining lease term. Losses on sale leaseback transactions were recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs, of $50.1 million and the deferred gain on the sale was approximately $27.3 million. On September 14, 2017, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with seven theatres for proceeds net of closing costs of $128.4 million and the deferred gain on sale was approximately $78.2 million. On December 18, 2017, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds net of closing costs of $7.8 million. The loss on sale of $0.5 million was recognized immediately. Upon adoption ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the unamortized deferred gains related to these transactions of $102.4 million were reclassified as a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. Impairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of theatre assets may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value, with the difference recognized as an impairment charge. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets that were impaired: ​

============================================================

​ During calendar 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $84.3 million on 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens and 14 theatres with 148 screens in the International markets, which was related to property held and used, operating lease right-of-use assets, and a U.S. property held and not used in other long-term assets. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million within investment expense (income), related to an equity interest investment without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method. During calendar 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $13.8 million on 13 theatres in the U.S. markets with 150 screens and 15 theatres with 118 screens in the International markets which was related to property held and used. During calendar 2017, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $43.6 million on 12 theatres in the U.S. markets with 179 screens which was related to property held and used. Foreign Currency Translation. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and the Company’s £ 500.0 million, 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) are not included in net earnings. If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recognized as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Employee Benefit Plans. The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., and a defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that is not frozen. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan and a defined contribution plan. The following table sets forth the plans’ benefit obligations and plan assets and the accrued liability for benefit costs included in the consolidated balance sheets: ​

​ The offset to the pension liability is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. For further information, see Note 14—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for pension amounts and activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, net periodic benefit costs were $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is recorded in general and administrative other and the non-operating component is recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: U.S. equity securities of 43 %, fixed including U.S. treasury securities and bond market funds of 27 %, international equity securities of 23 %, and private real estate of 7 %. The international pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation. Investments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which is determined using quoted market prices or estimated fair values. As of December 31, 2019, for the U.S. investment portfolio 7 % was valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information and 93 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. As of December 31, 2019, for the international investment portfolio 2 % was valued using quoted market prices from actively traded markets, 37 % included pooled separate accounts and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information, and 61 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Under the defined contribution plan, the Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, the Company matches 100 % of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3 % and 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of the employee’s eligible compensation. Income and Operating Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance. The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $29.4 million and $24.9 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $32.6 million, $25.1 million, and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income): ​

​ Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Leases. The Company adopted the guidance of ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The comparative information in the prior year has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 840, Leases, which was the accounting standard in effect for that period. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to recognize a lease ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 — Leases for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. ASC 606 was applied only to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The comparative information in 2017 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which was the accounting standard in effect during 2017. See Note 2 — Revenue Recognition for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers per the guidance in ASC 606. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. ASU 2018-02 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and early adoption of the amendments was permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a reclassification related to the stranded tax effects that increased accumulated other comprehensive income and increased accumulated deficit by $5.0 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2018. See Note 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for further information. Improving Presentation of Net Benefit Costs. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The guidance requires the service cost component of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from the services rendered by the pertinent employees while the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and reported outside a subtotal of operating income. The amendments in this guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018 and recorded a prior period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations to decrease general and administrative: other by $0.2 million, related to the other components of net benefit cost, with a corresponding increase to other expense (income) and decrease to other income of $0.2 million, respectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-18”). ASU 2016-18 requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018 and 2017 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. This guidance also requires a new disclosure to reconcile the cash balances within the consolidated statement of cash flows to the consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows: ​

​ Classification and measurement of financial instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 and recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to the unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities that are equity instruments with a corresponding decrease to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning of the year. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance will impact how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and evaluates its available-for-sale investments for impairment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). The guidance requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine whether to capitalize certain implementation costs or expense them as incurred. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2018-15 prospectively and is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ​ NOTE 2—REVENUE RECOGNITION ​ The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2018 for the adoption of ASC 606, are included in the following table: ​

​ (1) Included in this column upon adoption of ASC 842 are liabilities for leases that were previously classified as build-to-suit failed sale leaseback transactions that were included in the capital and finance lease obligations columns in the prior year. (2) Included in this column upon adoption of ASC 842 are fixed executory costs that were previously excluded as part of the minimum lease payments. Fixed executory costs, which primarily consist of common area maintenance, insurance and taxes that meet the classification of fixed payments are included as part of the minimum lease payments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had signed additional operating lease agreements for 11 theatres that have not yet commenced of approximately $226.8 million, which are expected to commence between 2020 and 2023, and carry lease terms of approximately 5 to 25 years . The timing of lease commencement is dependent on the landlord providing the Company with control and access to the related facility. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company modified the terms of an existing operating lease to reduce the lease term. The Company received a $35.0 million incentive from the landlord to enter into the new lease agreement. The Company has recorded amortization of the lease incentive as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term which reduced rent expense by $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 4— PROPERTY ​ A summary of property is as follows: ​

============================================================

Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ Buildings and improvements 5 to 45 years Leasehold improvements ​ 1 to 20 years ​ Furniture, fixtures and equipment ​ 1 to 11 years ​
============================================================

​ Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $413.6 million, $498.2 million, and $495.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. ​ NOTE 5—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ​ Activity of goodwill is presented below: ​

​ ​ ​ NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS ​ Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50 % voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2019, include interests in DCIP of 29.0 %, DCDC of 14.6 %, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0 %, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, 18.2 %, DCM of 50.0 %, and SCC of 10.0 %. The Company also has partnership interests in four U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50.0 % interest in 55 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s recorded investments are greater than its proportional ownership of the underlying equity in its non-consolidated affiliates by approximately $36.6 million. NCM Transactions Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2 % or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. In March 2018, the NCM Common Unit Adjustment ("CUA") resulted in a negative adjustment of 915,150 common units for the Company. The Company elected to return the units and recorded the surrendered common units as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $5.2 million, based upon a price per share of NCM, Inc. of $5.64 on March 15, 2018. The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. In June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, it reduced the Company’s then ownership of common stock shares in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM to zero. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5 %. The Company recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In March 2019, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 197,118 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $1.4 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $7.24 on March 14, 2019. The Company does not have significant influence over this entity and the investment is recorded at fair value each period. SV Holdco. (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity. SV Holdco has elected to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 30, 2018, Screenvision entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision. The Company received distributions and merger consideration of $45.8 million on July 2, 2018 upon consummation of the Screenvision merger and retains a 18.2 % common membership interest. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in Screenvision to $0 and recorded equity in earnings for the excess distribution of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. DCIP Transactions The Company will make capital contributions to DCIP for projector and installation costs in excess of an agreed upon cap. The Company pays equipment rent monthly and records the equipment rental expense on a straight-line basis over 12 years, or until DCIP contributes the projectors back to the Company reducing the Company’s investment in DCIP. Open Road Films Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded additional equity in earnings (loss) in Open Road Releasing, LLC (“Open Road”) of $(8.0) million, related to certain advances to and on behalf of Open Road. On August 4, 2017, the Company and Regal Entertainment Group consummated a transaction for the sale of all the issued and outstanding ownership interests in Open Road for total proceeds of $28.8 million of which the Company received $14.0 million in net proceeds after transaction expenses for its 50 % investment including collection of amounts due from Open Road of $4.8 million and recognized a gain on sale of $17.2 million. AC JV Transactions On December 26, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned 32 % by each of the Founding Members and 4 % by NCM. In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5 % per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments are due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing. The Company paid the sixth and final annual installment related to the promissory note in December 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the “Digital ESAs”) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. Summary Financial Information Investments in non-consolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2019, include interests in SV Holdco, DCM, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC, SCC, 55 theatres in Europe, four U.S. motion picture theatres, and other immaterial investments.

​ Senior Secured Credit Facility The Senior Secured Credit Facility is with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for a Revolving Credit Facility, including a borrowing capacity which is available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice. Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On April 22, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) amending the Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013, by and among the Company, each lender party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc. (“Citi”), as administrative agent. After giving effect to the Sixth Amendment, the Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $2,225.0 million in aggregate, consisting of (1) $2,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B loans maturing April 22, 2026 (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (2) a $225.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit) maturing April 22, 2024 (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The loans were used to repay all of the Company’s existing term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,338.5 million and to fund the redemptions of the 5.875 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 and the 6.0 % Senior Secured Notes due 2023. The Company recorded a loss of $16.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to these transactions, comprised of $14.1 million of extinguishment losses and $2.5 million of third party costs related to the modification of the Term Loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Company’s current and future wholly-owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including:

============================================================

============================================================
● a pledge of 100 % of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the Company or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than 65 % of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and
============================================================


============================================================

============================================================
● a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

============================================================
● 100 % of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and condemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest 100 % of such proceeds, subject to certain qualifications; and
============================================================


============================================================

============================================================
● 100 % of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.
============================================================

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal on the Term Loan Facility. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, except (1) for customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans under the Credit Facilities and (2) during the six months following the Amendment Closing Date, with respect to certain voluntary prepayments or refinancings of the Term Loan Facility that reduce the effective yield of the Term Loan Facility, which will be subject to a 1.00 % prepayment premium. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate of Citi and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) an applicable margin plus LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at the Company’s option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate of Citi and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. As of December 31, 2019, the applicable margins for LIBOR borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are 3.00 % and 2.50 % , respectively. The Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions will also be subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes a maintenance covenant that requires, in certain circumstances, compliance with a certain secured leverage ratio. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“Odeon Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders make available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £ 100.0 million ($131.2 million as of December 31, 2019). As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding and Odeon had £ 89.2 million ($117.0 million) available for borrowing, net of £ 10.8 million ($14.2 million) outstanding letters of credit (subject to limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness in the Company’s various debt instruments). The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility is 2.5 % plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee is 0.5 % of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral.

​ On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95 % Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 (the "Convertible Notes due 2024"). The Convertible Notes due 2024 mature on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2024 at 2.95 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on March 15, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to repurchase and retire 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock held by Wanda for $17.50 per share or approximately $421.0 million, associated legal fees of $2.6 million, and to pay a special dividend of $1.55 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, or approximately $160.5 million on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on September 25, 2018. The Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98 % over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also recorded debt issuance costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company recorded interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $32.6 million and for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million, respectively. The principal balance exceeded the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2024 by approximately $370.8 million as of December 31, 2019 based on the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock of $7.24 per share. Upon conversion by a holder thereof, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 (which represents an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2019, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 would be convertible into 31,662,269 shares of Class A common stock. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, in the event that the then-applicable conversion price is greater than 120 % of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten days prior to the second anniversary of issuance (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2024 is subject to a reset provision that would adjust the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision is subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. In addition, a trigger of the reset provision would result in up to 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda becoming subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The feature is contingent on the same reset of the conversion price which is part of the conversion feature. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature is not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 host and it is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $17.7 million and $(45.0) million, respectively. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than the special dividend referenced above and a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until the second anniversary of issuance and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2024 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the Convertible Notes due 2024) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024 for cash on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance at par if the price for the Company’s Class A common stock is equal to or greater than 150 % of the then applicable conversion price for 20 or more trading days out of a consecutive 30 day trading period (including the final three trading days), at which time the holders have the option to convert. The Company also has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024, between the second and third anniversary of issuance, if the reset provision described above is triggered at a redemption price in cash that would result in the noteholders realizing a 15 % internal rate of return from the date of issuance regardless of when any particular noteholder acquired its Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also bifurcated this redemption feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and considered it as a part of the overall fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded other income of $23.5 million and $66.4 million, respectively, related to the decrease in fair value of its derivative liability for the Convertible Notes due 2024. With certain exceptions, upon a change of control of the Company or if the Company’s Class A common stock is not listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market, the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 may require that the Company repurchase in cash all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and limit the ability of the Company to incur liens with respect to the Company’s senior subordinated notes or any debt incurred to refinance the Company’s senior subordinated notes. The Indenture also includes customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 under the Indenture. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by all the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. On September 14, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) providing for, among other things, registration rights with respect to the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2024. Subject to the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC not later than three months from the issuance date of the Convertible Notes in order to provide for resales of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company filed a registration statement with the SEC on December 14, 2018 to fulfill this requirement. Sterling Notes Due 2024 On November 8, 2016, the Company issued £ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "Sterling Notes due 2024") in a private offering. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $14.1 million related to the issuance of the Sterling Notes due 2024. The Sterling Notes due 2024 mature on November 15, 2024. The Company will pay interest on the Sterling Notes due 2024 at 6.375 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th, commencing on May 15, 2017. The Company may redeem some or all of the Sterling Notes due 2024 at any time on or after November 15, 2019 at 104.781 % of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100 % of the principal amount thereof on or after November 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On or prior to November 15, 2019, the Company may redeem the Sterling Notes due 2024 at par, including accrued and unpaid interest plus a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the Sterling Notes due 2024 private offering to pay the consideration for the Odeon acquisition and the related refinancing of Odeon debt assumed in the acquisition. The Sterling Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior subordinated unsecured basis by all of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. Following the closing of the Odeon acquisition on November 30, 2016 and the Carmike acquisition on December 21, 2016, neither Odeon or Carmike or any of its subsidiaries will guarantee the Sterling Notes due 2024. The indenture governing the Sterling Notes due 2024 contains covenants limiting other indebtedness, dividends, purchases or redemptions of stock, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and sales of assets. On November 8, 2016, in connection with the issuance of the Sterling Notes due 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement. Subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company is required to (1) file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) not later than 270 days from the issuance date with respect to the registered offer to exchange the notes for new notes of the Company having terms identical in all material respects to the notes and (2) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 within 365 days of the issuance date. On March 17, 2017, the Company issued £ 250.0 million additional aggregate principal amount of its Sterling Notes due 2024 at 106 % plus accrued interest from November 8, 2016 in a private offering. These additional Sterling Notes due 2024 were offered as additional notes under an indenture pursuant to which the Company had previously issued and has outstanding £ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 % Sterling Notes due 2024. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $12.7 million related to the issuance of the additional Sterling Notes due 2024. The Sterling Notes due 2024 mature on November 15, 2024. The Company will pay interest on the Sterling Notes due 2024 at 6.375 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th, commencing on May 15, 2017. Interest on the additional Sterling Notes will accrue from November 8, 2016. The Company may redeem some or all of the Sterling Notes due 2024 at any time on or after November 15, 2019, at 104.781 % of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100 % of the principal amount thereof on or after November 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes due 2024 using net proceeds from certain equity offerings completed on or prior to November 15, 2019. On or prior to November 15, 2019, the Company may redeem the Sterling Notes due 2024 at par, including accrued and unpaid interest plus a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the additional Sterling Notes to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Nordic plus related refinancing of Nordic debt assumed in the acquisition. On March 17, 2017, in connection with the issuance of the additional Sterling Notes due 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement. Subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company is required to (1) file one or more registration statements with the SEC not later than 270 days from November 8, 2016 with respect to the registered offer to exchange the notes for new notes of the Company having terms identical in all material respects to the notes and (2) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act within 365 days of November 8, 2016. The Company filed its Form S–4 registration statement related to the registration rights agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19, 2017, and it was declared effective June 7, 2017. All of the original notes were exchanged as of July 12, 2017. Notes Due 2025 On June 5, 2015, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.75 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 (the “Notes due 2025”) in a private offering. The Company capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately $11.4 million, related to the issuance of the Notes due 2025. The Notes due 2025 mature on June 15, 2025. The Company will pay interest on the Notes due 2025 at 5.75 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on June 15th and December 15th, commencing on December 15, 2015. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes due 2025 at any time on or after June 15, 2020 at 102.875 % of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100 % of the principal amount thereof on or after June 15, 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Prior to June 15, 2020, the Company may redeem the Notes due 2025 at par plus a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the Notes due 2025 private offering and cash on hand, to pay the consideration for the tender offer for the Notes due 2020, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and related transaction fees and expenses. The Notes due 2025 are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior subordinated unsecured basis by all of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. The indenture governing the Notes due 2025 contains covenants limiting other indebtedness, dividends, purchases or redemptions of stock, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and sales of assets. On June 5, 2015, in connection with the issuance of the Notes due 2025, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement. Subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company filed a registration statement on June 19, 2015 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to an offer to exchange the original Notes due 2025 for exchange Notes due 2025 registered pursuant to an effective registration statement; the registration statement was declared effective on June 29, 2015, and the Company commenced the exchange offer.

In such event, the Company may exercise such right to purchase shares from Wanda from time to time pursuant to the ROFR Agreement in its sole discretion, subject to approval by the disinterested directors of the Board.

At December 31, 2019, the Company determined that achieving the three-year net profit performance thresholds was improbable and reversed all previously recorded expense. If the Company later determines that the performance thresholds are probable, then historical expense would be reinstated, and the Company would resume recognizing expense. The Company reversed all previously recorded expense and recorded a credit for these awards of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which reversed the expense of $5.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 in general and administrative: other expense and ceased accruing any additional expense on these units. During the year ended December 31, 2017, PSU awards were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company determined that achieving the three-year performance thresholds of the 2017 Performance Stock Units was improbable and reversed $1.8 million of stock-based compensation expense and ceased accruing any additional expense on these units. The Company did not recognize any further expense in years 2019 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, PSU awards were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with both a three-year cumulative adjusted free cash flow and net earnings performance target condition and a service condition, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company determined that achieving the three-year performance thresholds of the 2016 Performance Stock Units was improbable and reversed $2.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and ceased accruing any additional expense on these units. The Company did not recognize any further expense in 2018.

● Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2019, a PSU market condition award of 300,000 was granted to an executive officer of the Company that will vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s common stock (“2019 PSU executive”). Achievement of the target prices will be determined using the volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over a 20 trading-day period. Any unvested PSUs remaining after 10 years will be forfeited. If service is terminated prior to December 2, 2029, all unvested PSUs shall be forfeited. The target prices and vesting tranches are set forth in the table below:

============================================================

​ The vested PSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting. A dividend equivalent equal to the amount paid in respect of one share of Class A common stock underlying the PSUs began to accrue with respect to the PSUs on the date of grant. Such accrued dividend equivalents are paid to the holder upon vesting of the PSUs. The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the PSUs. This model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the PSUs: ​

============================================================

============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, 2019 Expected stock price volatility ​ 45.0 % Expected dividend yield ​ 9.23 % Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.83 % Grant-date stock price ​ $8.67
============================================================

​ The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equivalent to the derived service period. The expected dividend yield is based on annual expected dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the treasury yield rates as of the date of grant for a period equivalent to the performance measurement period. The fair value of each PSU is amortized over the requisite or derived service period, which is up to 4.6 years. The PSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 have a grant date fair value of $1.4 million. Since the award was granted in December 2019, the Company recognized an immaterial amount of expense for these awards in general and administrative: other expense, during the year ended December 31, 2019.

● Performance Stock Unit Transition Award: In recognition of the shift in 2016 from one-year to three-year performance periods for annual equity awards, on March 31, 2017, PSU transition awards were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and a service condition, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2017 and ended on December 31, 2017.
============================================================

No PSU Transition Awards vested in 2017 as the Company did not meet the fiscal year 2017 net profit threshold, and as a result, all of the PSUTs were forfeited and the units were returned to the 2013 Employee Incentive Plan pool.

​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 for domestic operations. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. On the basis of this evaluation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, a valuation allowance of $221.6 million was established domestically on the Company’s net deferred tax assets and considering indefinite-lived intangibles. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income is reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company maintained its domestic valuation allowance. An international valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets held in Spain was released in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting in a $41.5 million benefit to income tax expense. A significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was a cumulative income position over a three-year period. Statutory taxable earnings that permit the use of these deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, have stabilized to a profit position with significant improvement in 2019. Strategic initiatives have provided sufficient positive evidence that has resulted in the Company concluding the realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, limiting the amount of deductible interest expense, limiting executive compensation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 % to a flat 21 % rate, effective January 1, 2018. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance at December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $121.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is comprised of $88.6 million of deferred tax expense associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, as reflected in the rate reconciliation, and $210.4 million of deferred tax benefit associated with the partial release of the Company’s valuation allowance as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has assessed the deemed mandatory repatriation provisions of the Tax Reform Act, and is projecting no impact to current year domestic taxable income as it relates to undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company does not intend to distribute earnings in a taxable manner, and therefore intends to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the 100 percent dividends received deduction provided for in the Tax Reform Act, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes. As a result, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. While the Tax Reform Act provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current and prior year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current and prior year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The income tax provision (benefit) reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components: ​

​ The Company generated alternative minimum taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, which fully offset the taxes due to the utilization of tax credits. Under the Tax Reform Act, alternative minimum tax credit will be refundable in the future.

​ The Company has federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $380.9 million. Approximately $290.9 million will begin to expire in 2020, and will completely expire in 2036, and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $90.0 million can be used indefinitely. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $487.2 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $6.2 million, which will expire in various amounts between years 2022 and 2028. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $380.4 million. Approximately $374.0 million may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years .

​ The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company determined it is not necessary to accrue additional interest and penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 related to prior years was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $12.2 million and $15.2 million, respectively. There are currently, unrecognized tax benefits which the Company anticipates will be resolved in the next 12 months; however, the Company is unable at this time to estimate what the impact on its unrecognized tax benefits will be. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after March 28, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2019, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions. On January 22, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On September 23, 2019, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. On October 2, 2019, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Kenna v. Aron , et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-09148 (the “Kenna Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Kenna Action asserts the same claims as the Gantulga Action based on substantially similar allegations. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on October 17, 2019. On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of common stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On October 25, 2019, the court granted a motion to stay the action for six months to allow the Special Litigation Committee to complete its investigation. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. Due to the variety of remedies available, the Company believes that if the current tenant defaulted on the leases it would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​ NOTE 12—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ​ Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ​

(1) The investments relate to a non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement on behalf of certain members of management. The Company has an equivalent liability for this related-party transaction recorded in other long-term liabilities for the deferred compensation obligation.
============================================================

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. See Note 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the unrealized gain on equity securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: ​

There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and discount rates used in determining fair value, and therefore are classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy.

​ Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for level 2 inputs. The level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these Convertible Notes. The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. ​ The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. ​ NOTE 13—OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. The Company has identified two reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Denmark. Operations located in Austria were sold during the first quarter of 2019. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees and other loyalty programs, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: ​

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision, (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

(4) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operators in certain International markets. See below for a reconciliation of the Company’s equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where the Company holds a significant market share, the Company believes attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments. The Company also provides services to these theatre operators including information technology systems, certain on-screen advertising services and the Company’s gift card and package ticket program. As these investments relate only to the Company’s Nordic acquisition, the second quarter of 2017 represents the first time the Company has made this adjustment and does not impact prior historical presentations of Adjusted EBITDA.

============================================================

​ Vested RSUs and PSU’s have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs are subject to performance conditions and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, unvested PSUs of 477,630 and 364,269 , respectively, at the minimum performance target were not considered in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period and unvested RSU’s of 1,377,992 and 210,558 , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2017, unvested PSUs and Transition PSUs of 187,468 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 88,194 were not considered in the computation of diluted loss because they would anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes due 2024 that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has not adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 to eliminate the interest expense of $32.6 million and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $23.5 million, in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. The Company has not included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 31.7 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 30, 2019, as the effects would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adjusted net earnings to eliminate the interest expense and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $9.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively, in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects were dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $18.95 per share, the Convertible Notes due 2024 are convertible into 31,662,269 Class A common shares. ​ ​ NOTE 16—SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED) ​ ​

​ ​ NOTE 17—ACQUISITION ​ Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB ​ On March 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) for cash. The purchase price for Nordic was cash of SEK 5,756 million ($654.9 million), which includes payment of interest on the equity value and repayment of shareholder loans. As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed the indebtedness of Nordic of approximately SEK 1,269 million ($144.4 million) and indebtedness of approximately € 156 million ($169.5 million) as of March 28, 2017, which was refinanced subsequent to the acquisition. The Company also assumed approximately SEK 13.5 million ($1.6 million) and approximately € 1.0 million ($1.1 million) of interest rate swaps related to the indebtedness which were repaid following the acquisition. All amounts have been converted into US Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.11378 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0865 , which were the exchange rates on March 27, 2017. The acquisition was being treated as a purchase in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. The allocation of purchase price is based on management’s judgment after evaluating several factors, including a valuation assessment. The Company finalized the appraisals for both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The following is a summary of the final allocation of the purchase price: ​

(1) Amounts recorded for property include land, buildings, capital lease assets, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. During the year ended 31, 2018, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments primarily related to the preliminary valuation of property, intangible assets, equity method investments, financing lease obligations and related tax adjustments. (2) Additional information for intangible assets acquired on March 28, 2017 is presented below:

​ (3) Amounts recorded for goodwill are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. (4) Including current portion of approximately $1.1 million. (5) Amounts recorded for other long-term liabilities include unfavorable leases of approximately $20.0 million with an amortization period of 9.3 years. (6) Includes equity method investments of $64.7 million. The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals, and market comparables. The purchase price paid by the Company in the acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill because it exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company paid a price in excess of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed because the acquisition of Nordic enhances its position as the largest movie exhibition company in Europe and broadens and diversifies its European platform. The Company also expects to realize synergy and cost savings related to the acquisition because of purchasing and procurement economies of scale. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company incurred acquisition-related and transition costs for Nordic of approximately $1.5 million and $10.1 million, which were included in general and administrative expense: merger, acquisition and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Nordic was acquired on March 28, 2017 and the Company immediately began integrating the operations. ​ ​ NOTE 18— SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ​ On February 26, 2020, Holdings’ Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share on Class A and Class B common stock, payable on March 23, 2020 to stockholders of record on March 9, 2020. The dividend decrease of $0.17 per share compared to the Company’s previous historical declarations of $0.20 per share reduces the total dividend payout for the quarter by approximately $18.0 million. Holdings’ Board of Directors approved a modification to the 2018 and 2019 PSU awards in February 2020, which eliminated the net profit performance target threshold. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020. ​ ​ NOTE 19—CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ The accompanying condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10, Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered.

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Independent Auditor's Report ​ Management Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ​ We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, members' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes to the financial statements. ​ Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements ​ Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. ​ Auditor's Responsibility ​ Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. ​ An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. ​ We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. ​ Opinion ​ In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. ​ /s/ CohnReznick LLP ​ Roseland, New Jersey February 18, 2020 ​ DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ($in thousands) ​ ​

("Cinemark") and Regal/DCIP Holdings, LLC ("Regal") (collectively, the "Founding Members"). On March 10, 2010, the Company completed an initial financing transaction for the deployment of Digital Systems utilizing its subsidiary entities Kasima, LLC ("Kasima"), Kasima Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") and Kasima Parent Holdings, LLC ("Parent") to execute its business plan. Kasima is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Parent is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DCIP. As part of the initial financing transaction, Parent entered into a note purchase agreement with a third-party investment fund. On March 31, 2011, the Company obtained the incremental financing necessary to complete its planned deployment of Digital Systems and on May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced all of its outstanding senior secured debt, extending the term of that debt and lowering its effective interest rate. On March 31, 2014, Parent repaid, in full, the outstanding notes under the note purchase agreement. On August 2, 2019, Holdings repaid, in full, the then-outstanding debt under its Credit Facility and retired that facility (see Note 7). Digital Systems are purchased by Kasima and leased to each Founding Member or one of its affiliates (each such entity, an "Exhibitor") pursuant to the terms of a Master Equipment Lease Agreement ("ELA"). Kasima facilitates the installation of the leased Digital Systems into each Exhibitor's theatres pursuant to the terms of an Installation Agreement. The Exhibitor is responsible for the ongoing maintenance and insurance of the Digital Systems. The Company has also entered into (and assigned to Kasima) long-term Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements ("DCDAs") with six major motion picture studios ("Major Studios") pursuant to which Kasima receives a virtual print fee ("VPF") each time the studio books a film or certain other content on the Digital Systems. These agreements will end on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) or when the Company reaches “cost recoupment”, each as defined in the DCDAs (see Note 2). Other content distributors have entered into DCDAs or shorter term agreements with the Company that provide for the payment of VPFs (or as more fully described and defined in Note 2, alternative content fees or “ACFs”) to Kasima for bookings of the distributor’s content on a Digital System. One such distributor, AC JV, LLC (“Fathom Events”), is related to DCIP through common ownership. On June 20, 2011, DCIP and Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership ("CDCP") entered into a long-term management services agreement (an "MSA" and with respect to CDCP, the "CDCP MSA") to manage a similar deployment of Digital Systems in Canada and to perform certain other specified services for CDCP related thereto (see Note 2). CDCP is a Canadian limited partnership formed by Cineplex Entertainment LP ("Cineplex") and Empire Theatres Ltd. ("Empire") to facilitate the purchase and deployment of Digital Systems to their theatres in Canada. On April 1, 2012, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Cinemark USA, Inc., a Texas corporation and an affiliate of Cinemark, to manage deployment of Digital Systems to theatres operated by its affiliates in Latin America (the "CNI MSA"). On September 1, 2014, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Fathom Events to provide it with management and software related services. The services we provide under this agreement have changed from time to time. The Company anticipates reaching cost recoupment as defined in the DCDAs in the fourth quarter of 2020. At that time the revenue from these contracts will end and it is anticipated the ELAs will be cancelled, ownership of the digital systems will be distributed to the Founding Members and the Company will enter a period of winding down its other activities in preparation for the cessation or transfer of the Company’s business. ​ ​ Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ​ Principles of consolidation ​ The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DCIP and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. ​ New accounting standards ​ In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (as modified “ASU 2016-02”), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities with corresponding “right-of-use” assets and was effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2018, subject to early adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. Upon adoption , th e Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability (See Note 9). ​ The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: ​ a. there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; b. a renewal option is exercised, or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; c. there is a change in the determination of whether fulfillment is dependent on a specified asset; or d. there is a substantial change to the asset. ​ Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). ​ Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ​ Use of estimates ​ The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to depreciation and recoverability of property and equipment, amortization, the valuation of derivative agreements and the reimbursement liability concerning equipment warranty and replacement costs under the ELAs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ​ Cash and cash equivalents ​ The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments and consists primarily of money market funds and other overnight investments. The Company maintains bank accounts with major banks, which from time to time may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. ​ Concentration of credit risk ​ For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had three customers that represented 36%, 33% and 34%, respectively, of operating revenues. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, three and four customers, each parties to the DCDAs, represented 50% and 55%, respectively, of net accounts receivable. None of the Company's other customers individually represented more than 10% of operating revenues or accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 or 2018, or for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. ​ The Company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable, which consists primarily of amounts owed by the Major Studios and other digital content distributors. The Company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit losses. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred bad debt expense of $674,000, $4,198,000 and zero, respectively. Bad debt expense in 2018 related primarily to two studio bankruptcies. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, management has determined that there is no requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts. ​ Concentration in foreign countries ​ The Company receives revenues from CDCP pursuant to the CDCP MSA with all payments being made in U.S. dollars. For 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenues earned from Canadian sources totaled $1,808,000, $1,812,000 and $1,799,000, respectively. Revenues earned by the Company under the CNI MSA for theatres located in Latin America was $548,000, $722,000 and $818,000, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Fair value and credit risk ​ All current assets and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. The Company's Credit Facility (see Note 7) was comprised of floating rate instruments and management believes fair value approximated carrying value. ​ Property and equipment, net ​ Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Computer equipment and software 3-5 years Leasehold improvements 5 years Digital cinema projection equipment 15 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years
============================================================

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it needed to reevaluate the useful life of its digital cinema projection equipment based on accelerated replacement of systems by the Exhibitors and other indicators. It was determined the estimate of useful life needed to be changed from 17.5 years to 15 years and as of December 31, 2019, a $13,537,000 adjustment was recorded. ​ Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Costs for general and administrative expenses, overhead, maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems, are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or other disposition of any property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposal is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. ​ Fair value measurements ​ The Company accounts for and reports the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company applies fair value accounting for financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. ​ The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"): ​ Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ​ Level 2 : Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ​ Level 3 : Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions. ​ The fair value of the Company's assets under its Interest Rate Swap (as defined below) was based upon observable market-based inputs that reflect the present values of the difference between estimated future fixed rate payments and future variable receipts and, therefore, is classified within Level 2. The Level 2 fair value of the Company's Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2018 was $472,000. Together with the payoff of the Credit Facility on August 2, 2019, the Interest Rate Swap was terminated. ​ Income taxes ​ The Company is a limited liability company and, as such, is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, as a partnership for tax purposes, the Company is not a taxable entity for federal income taxes and is not subject to significant state income taxes. However, the Company does pay certain state taxes based on revenue or net income that are reported as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income or loss of the Company as a limited liability company is reported to and included in the individual income tax returns of its members. Tax years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. ​ Impairment of long-lived assets ​ The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or conditions exist that indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for recoverability is based primarily on the Company's ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If the total of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the total carrying value of an asset, the asset is deemed not to be recoverable and possibly impaired. The Company then estimates the fair value of the asset to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the expected future discounted cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. ​ Revenue recognition ​ The Company follows the provisions of the FASB’s ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ​ Most of the Company's revenues are VPFs from Major Studios under the DCDAs. The Company earns VPF revenue when movies and certain other content distributed by Major Studios and other content distributors are booked and exhibited on screens utilizing the Company's Digital Systems. VPFs are earned and payable based on a fee schedule outlined in the DCDAs and other VPF agreements. The VPF revenue is recognized in the period in which it is earned, generally the first time the content is booked and exhibited in the theatre auditorium for which a Digital System has been installed. ​ The DCDAs with the Major Studios require the payment of VPFs for a period that ends on the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) for all Digital Systems scheduled to be deployed over a period of up to five years, or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. Cost recoupment occurs when revenues attributable to the Digital Systems exceed the costs associated with their purchase (including financing), deployment, administration and other allowed amounts, all as defined in the DCDAs. ​ In addition to VPF revenue, the Company also earns a fee each time certain digital content other than feature films (e.g., concerts, sporting events and opera performances) is booked and exhibited on a Digital System. The Company refers to fees derived on a per-exhibition basis from these alternative forms of digital content as ACFs. ACFs may be paid by the distributor of the alternative content pursuant to an agreement with the Company or by the Exhibitor showing the content pursuant to its ELA. ACF revenue is recognized in the period in which the alternative content is exhibited. ​ Lease revenues in respect of the Digital Systems and certain other rental and usage fees are earned by the Company in accordance with the terms of the ELAs. All amounts due to the Company under these agreements are recognized as revenue when earned and any unearned amounts are recorded as deferred revenue. The initial lease term for each piece of equipment deployed under the ELAs begins on the date the equipment is placed in service and continues for 12 years, with the first and last month incurring one-half of the monthly lease payment otherwise due. ​ The Company generates multiple revenue streams from the leased Digital Systems under the ELAs as follows: ​ Lease fees are payable by the Exhibitors monthly and prior to March 31, 2014 were comprised of a fixed base lease rate plus a "step-up" rate component for all equipment (regardless of lease commencement date) that was to occur on October 1, 2016. The Company recognized lease revenue from these fees on a straight-line method making an allowance for the step-up in rent that was to occur. On March 31, 2014, the ELAs were amended to remove the scheduled step-up lease payments. The accumulated effects of the amendments are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction in revenue over the remaining terms of the ELAs. ​ Peak period payments were due under the ELAs when the leased Digital Systems were taken out of service by an Exhibitor for one or more consecutive defined "peak periods" (generally a weekend) as a result of relocation, damage or a complex closing. Peak period payments, if any, were recognized, billed and paid monthly. The Founding Member’s obligation to pay these fees was terminated on October 1, 2019. ​ In accordance with the ELAs, the Exhibitors are required to acquire extended warranties with respect to the leased Digital Systems covering the period from the expiration of the initial included manufacturer's warranty through the date of repayment of the Credit Facility (the "Warranty End Date"), but in no event later than 12 years from the effective date of the ELAs. Following the Warranty End Date, the Exhibitors may choose to continue extended warranty coverage through the expiration of the DCDAs (the "DCDA End Date"). The DCDA End Date will occur on the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) of the Digital Systems or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. The Company expects that the Exhibitors will maintain extended warranty coverage through the DCDA End Date. Pursuant to the ELAs, the Company is required to reimburse the Exhibitor for the costs of the extended warranties (and/or equipment replacement costs) subject to quarterly caps set forth in the ELAs. This contractual obligation by the Company to incur costs at a future date for the extended warranties or replacement costs when the leased equipment is purchased created a liability at the purchase date and a contra revenue adjustment in respect of revenues derived under the ELAs that is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. During the year ended December 31, 2019, based on performance to date and revised projections of future activities, management estimates that cost recoupment will be achieved in 2020. As a result, management now estimates that the warranty reimbursement obligation will end during 2020 rather than 2021. This change in estimate resulted in a $8,680,000 reduction in the overall warranty liability and related warranty asset. The impact of this change on the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent years is not material. ​ The Company also earns revenues in respect of the services DCIP provides under the MSAs. The revenues are earned ratably as the services are performed under the respective agreements. ​ Subsequent events ​ The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 18, 2020, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. ​ ​ Note 3 - Financing Transactions ​ On May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced its then outstanding senior secured debt, extending its term and lowering its effective interest rate. The transaction consisted of a $755,000,000 senior secured loan commitment (the Credit Facility described in Note 7) to Kasima from a group of commercial banks and institutional investors. This Credit Facility was paid off and retired on August 2, 2019. Note 4 - Consolidated Balance Sheet Components ​ Restricted cash ​ The Company had restricted cash of $0 and $3,702,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in the form of an interest reserve escrow account and excess cost escrow account for the funding of Digital Systems in excess of costs caps, both related to the Credit Facility (see Note 7). ​ Accounts receivable, net ​ Accounts receivable, net consists of the following ($in thousands): ​

​ Revenues earned under the ELAs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $18,989,000, $20,409,000 and $20,629,000, respectively. ​ ​ Note 7- Long-term Debt, net ​ Credit facilities ​ On May 17, 2013, DCIP, Holdings and Kasima entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC as Administrative Agent and a group of lenders which agreed to provide Kasima a $75 million revolving line of credit ("Revolver") and a $680 million term loan ("Term Loan B" and together with the Revolver, the "Credit Facility"). The Term Loan B was fully funded at the closing of the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Term Loan B were used to repay all amounts under the then outstanding credit facility and to repay fees, transaction costs and other expenses incurred in connection with such repayment and the establishment of the Credit Facility. All costs of Digital Systems exceeding established caps must be funded by capital contributions from the Founding Members. The Credit Facility was retired on August 2, 2019 and all outstanding debt was repaid. ​ Interest expense on long-term debt was $1,042,000, $5,327,000 and $10,602,000, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Derivatives ​ The Interest Rate Swap contracts were entered into for interest expense cost protection from rising variable interest rates and are associated with the Credit Facility which was paid off and retired on August 2, 2019. ​ Note 8 - Retirement Plan ​ The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for eligible employees under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's plan provides for eligible employees to contribute up to 80% of eligible compensation with a Company contribution of 4% of eligible wages. All employees are eligible to participate in the plan upon hire. The Company's contributions to the plan totaled $146,000, $139,000 and $140,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Note 9 - Operating Leases ​ The Company has various operating lease agreements for its offices. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. At December 31, 2019, the remaining lease terms range from two to 25 months. The agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties in the contract. ​ The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 beginning January 1, 2019 and adopted the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Accordingly, the Company: ​

============================================================

​ In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively determine the lease term and assess the impairment of its right-of-use assets. At the date of transition, the Company recognized an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset. The amount of lease liability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments as of January 1, 2019 discounted using the Company’s secured borrowing rate as of that date. ​ A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. ​ The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to operating leases:

​ The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rates of the operating leases were 23 months and 4.80%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. ​ Note 10 - Commitments ​ Employment agreements ​ The Company has employment agreements with two of its key executives setting forth key compensation terms (generally annual salary plus a defined bonus) and providing each executive with a severance benefit in the case the executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive resigns with good reason, each as defined. Tax matters The Company is from time to time audited by state and local taxing authorities and as of December 31, 2019, certain assessments are in negotiation with various taxing authorities. The Company believes the potential tax liabilities will be resolved for $4,335,000 and has accrued this amount as of December 31, 2019. ​ Note 11 - Related Party Transactions ​ At December 31, 2019, all of the Company's Digital Systems are leased to the Exhibitors under the ELAs. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenues earned from the Exhibitors totaled $18,989,000, $20,409,000 and $20,629,000, respectively. Net accounts receivable due from the Exhibitors totaled $525,000 and $1,092,000, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and will be settled in cash. Payments under the ELAs are generally due on the fifth day of the month after billing. At times, the Company purchases digital equipment from the Exhibitors at cost subject to caps established in the ELAs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no liability for reimbursement of equipment purchases due to the Exhibitors. The $11,530,000 warranty reimbursement liability represents a liability to reimburse the Exhibitors for the extended equipment warranty and other replacement costs (as defined in the ELAs) as cash payments that began in 2011 and continues through the DCDA End Date (see Note 2). Warranty reimbursements earned for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $45,851,000, $41,717,000 and $32,680,000, respectively. Cash reimbursement payments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $45,492,000, $39,587,000 and $30,280,000, respectively, and payables totaled $11,530,000 and $11,171,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Exhibitors terminated their ELAs with respect to an aggregate of 83, 38, and 81 Digital Systems, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the ELAs, the Exhibitors were required to purchase these Digital Systems from the Company at a defined Termination Amount per Digital System. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, total Termination Amounts paid by the Exhibitors in the aggregate were $673,000, $305,000 and $2,786,000, respectively, resulting in a loss on sale to the Company of $2,531,000, $1,250,000 and $1,252,000 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenues earned from Fathom Events totaled $3,612,000, $3,719,000 and $3,004,000, respectively, (see Note 1). Accounts receivable due from Fathom Events at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $671,000 and $635,000, respectively.
