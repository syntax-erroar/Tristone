​ ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

​ ​ ​ ​ Valuation of operating leases Description of the Matter ​ At December 31, 2021, the Company’s operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities were $4.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. As discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) for operating leases. Since most of the leases do not provide a determinable implicit rate, the Company estimated its IBR used to calculate its right of use assets and lease liabilities. Auditing the Company’s estimate of the IBR was especially challenging as it involved a high degree of subjective judgment when testing the reasonableness of the inputs and appropriateness

of the rates applied to each lease. In particular, the estimate of the IBR is sensitive to significant assumptions such as the determination of the current credit rating and selection of the associated yield curve. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination of the IBR. For example, we tested management’s review controls over this process. To test the Company’s determination of the IBR, our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of management’s methodology for developing the IBR and a comparison of certain assumptions used by management to our independent estimates which were developed with the assistance of our specialists. ​ ​ ​

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020 Kansas City, Missouri March 1, 2022 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021 and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Kansas City, Missouri March 1, 2022 ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

​ ​ See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ​ ​ ​ AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 201 9 ​ NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. Temporarily Suspended or Limited Operations. Throughout the first quarter of 2020, the Company temporarily suspended theatre operations in its U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of the Company’s guests and theatre staff. As of March 17, 2020, all of the Company’s U.S. and International theatre operations were temporarily suspended. The Company resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. As of March 31, 2021, the Company operated at 585 domestic theatres with limited seating capacities, representing approximately 99 % of its domestic theatres. As of June 30, 2021, the Company operated 593 domestic theatres, representing approximately 100 % of its domestic theatres with remaining seating capacity restrictions winding down throughout the quarter. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the Company operated 596 and 593 domestic theatres, respectively, representing essentially 100 % of its domestic theatres. Total revenues for the U.S. markets increased $1,049.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the Company operated at 97 international theatres, with limited seating capacities, representing approximately 27 % of its international theatres. As of June 30, 2021, the Company operated 335 international theatres with limited seating capacities, representing approximately 95 % of its international theatres. The majority of international theatre operations were suspended for the first two months of the second quarter of 2021 due to a COVID-19 resurgence and did not reopen until early June 2021. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the Company operated 351 and 337 international theatres, respectively, representing approximately 99 % and 95 %, respectively, of its international theatres. Total revenues for the International markets increased $236.4 million for the year ended December 31. 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adjusted certain elements of its business strategy and took significant steps to preserve cash. The Company is continuing to take significant measures to further strengthen its financial position and enhance its operations, by eliminating non-essential costs, including reductions to its variable costs and elements of its fixed cost structure, introducing new initiatives, and optimizing its theatrical footprint. Additionally, the Company enhanced liquidity through debt issuances, debt exchanges and equity sales. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations, Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity, and Note 16—Subsequent Events for further information. The table below summarizes net increase (decrease) in cash equivalents and restricted cash by quarter for the year ended December 31, 2021:

​ The Company’s net cash used in operating activities improved by $79.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, $119.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, and $160.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This is primarily attributable to continued increases in attendance and industry box office revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company will continue to repay rent amounts that were deferred during the pandemic, which will increase its cash outflows from operating activities. See Note 3 — Leases for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the remaining $315.1 million of rentals that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for increased rent and planned capital expenditures, and comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under its debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Odeon Term Loan Facility for at least the next twelve months. In order to achieve net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, the Company believes it will need to continue to increase attendance levels significantly compared to 2021 and achieve levels in line with pre COVID-19 attendance. The Company believes the global re-opening of its theatres, the anticipated volume of titles available for theatrical release, and the anticipated broad appeal of many of those titles will support increased attendance levels. The Company believes that the sequential increases in attendance experienced each quarter as 2021 progressed are positive signs of continued demand for the moviegoing experience. However, there remain significant risks that may negatively impact attendance, including a resurgence of COVID-19 related restrictions, potential movie-goer reluctance to attend theatres due to concerns about COVID-19 variant strains, movie studios release schedules and direct to streaming or other changing movie studio practices. The Company entered the Ninth Amendment (as defined in Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations) pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the fixed date for the termination of the suspension period for the financial covenant (the secured leverage ratio) applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations) from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, which was further extended by the Eleventh Amendment (as defined in Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations) from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein. The Company is currently subject to minimum liquidity requirements of approximately $144 million, of which $100 million is required under the conditions for the Extended Covenant Suspension Period ending March 31, 2023, as amended, under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and £ 32.5 million (approximately $44 million) of which is required under the Odeon Term Loan Facility. Following the expiration of the Extended Covenant Suspension Period ending March 31, 2023, the Company will be subject to the financial covenant under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of the last day of each quarter on which the aggregate principal amount of revolving loans, and letters of credit (excluding letters of credit that are cash collateralized) in excess of $25 million, outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35 % of the principal amount of commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility then in effect, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2023. The Company currently expects it will be able to comply with this financial covenant, however, the Company does not anticipate the need to borrow under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility during the next twelve months. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. The Company’s liquidity needs thereafter will depend, among other things, on the timing of movie releases and its ability to generate cash from operations. The Company’s cash expenditures for rent increased significantly in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2021 as previously deferred rent payments and landlord concessions started to become current obligations. The Company received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. As a result, deferred lease amounts were approximately $315.1 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note 3 — Leases for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the deferred lease amounts due to COVID-19. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Noncontrolling Interests and Baltic Theatre Sale. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. On August 28, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU, which consists of nine theatres located in the Baltic region (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and is included in the Company’s International markets reportable segment, for total consideration of approximately € 77.25 million, including cash of approximately € 64.35 million or $76.6 million prior to any transaction costs. This transaction was undertaken by the Company to further increase its liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet at a transaction multiple that demonstrates that market participants ascribe positive value to the business. The completion of the sale took place in several steps, as noted below, and was contingent upon clearance from each regulatory competition council in each country. The Company received $37.5 million (€ 31.53 million) cash consideration upon entering into the sale agreement on August 28, 2020 and paid $0.5 million in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company transferred an equity interest of 49 % in Forum Cinemas OU to the purchaser and recorded an initial noncontrolling interest of $34.9 million in total equity (deficit). Transaction costs of $1.4 million and net gain of $1.2 million related to the sale of 49 % equity interest of Lithuania and Estonia and the 100 % disposal of Latvia were recorded in additional paid-in capital during the year ended December 31, 2020 and were recorded in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021 when the remaining 51 % interests in Lithuania and Estonia were disposed. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received cash consideration of $6.2 million (€ 5.3 million), net of cash of $0.2 million for the remaining 51 % equity interest in Latvia. At December 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group that were previously included in the International markets reportable segment were; goodwill of $41.8 million, property, net, of $13.0 million, operating lease right-of-use assets, net of $15.7 million, and current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $2.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s noncontrolling interest of 49 % in Lithuania and Estonia was $26.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received cash consideration of $34.2 million (€ 29.4 million), net of cash disposed of $0.4 million and transaction costs of $1.3 million, for the remaining 51 % equity interest in Estonia, 51 % equity interest in Lithuania and eliminated the Company’s noncontrolling interest in Forum Cinemas OU. The Company recorded the net gain from the sale of its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU of $5.5 million (net of transaction costs of $2.6 million) in investment expense (income), during the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recorded at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100 % of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 13 % to 18.5 % of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using more than 10 years of accumulated data. The Company also recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed exchange tickets using the proportional method. In the International markets, certain exchange tickets are subject to expiration dates, which triggers recognition of non-redemption in other revenues. The Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The Company is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes government grants once the grant requirements have been met. Grants relating to specific costs are treated as a reduction of that cost in the consolidated statements of operations. General grants are recorded within other expense (income). Grants related to the construction of fixed assets are treated as reductions to the associated fixed asset cost. Certain grants contain stipulations around the use of funds which could trigger claw backs if the stipulations are violated. Film Exhibition Costs. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company recorded film payables of $150.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Food and Beverage Costs. The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement. The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”) with National CineMedia, LLC (“NCM”) includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon recognition, the Company records an increase to advertising revenues with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 — Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment (“CUA”) and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5 % to 18.25 %, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. Customer Engagement Programs. AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program in the U.S. markets which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM for a flat annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs ® Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. The Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. AMC Stubs ® A-List is the Company’s monthly subscription-based tier of the AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 and $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. The Company suspended the recognition of deferred revenues related to certain loyalty programs, gift cards, and exchange tickets during the period in which its operations were temporarily suspended. As the Company re-opened theatres, A-List members had the option to reactivate their subscription, which restarted the monthly charge for the program. Starting in July of 2021, all A-List monthly subscriptions were automatically reactivated and the Company has resumed a more normal recognition pattern for deferred revenues related to certain loyalty programs, gift cards and exchange tickets. Advertising Costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $28.4 million, $10.7 million, and $42.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents. All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents for the U.S. markets and International markets were $1,311.4 million and $281.1 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $222.9 million and $85.4 million, respectively. Restricted Cash. Restricted cash is cash held in the Company's bank accounts in International markets as a guarantee for certain landlords. Derivative Asset and Liability. Prior to September 14, 2020, the Company remeasured the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B common stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Convertible Notes due 2026 at fair value each reporting period until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other expense (income). The Company obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies used a Monte Carlo simulation approach and were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s Common Stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature were key inputs for the estimation of fair value that were expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other expense (income) related to derivative asset fair value adjustments of $0 , $19.6 million and $17.7 million, during the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and other expense (income) related to derivative liability fair value adjustments of $0 , $89.4 million, and $(23.5) million, during the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations and Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity for further discussions. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets were recorded at fair value for intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to management contracts, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets, and trademark and trade names. The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $15.2 million in the International markets. There were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019. Investments. The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment expense (income). Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 — Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.3 % interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Media Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0 % interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6 % interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 10.0 % interest in Saudi Cinema Company LLC (“SCC”); a 50 % ownership interest in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50 % ownership interest in 57 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. In 2020, the Company early adopted the amendments in S-X Rule 1-02(w) related to significant subsidiary tests of nonconsolidated entities. Goodwill. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $2,429.8 million and $2,547.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company evaluates goodwill recorded at the Company’s two reporting units (Domestic Theatres and International Theatres). Also, the Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests by assessing the qualitative factors to determine if an event occurs or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis. If an impairment analysis is needed, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test for goodwill, which involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Qualitative impairment tests performed during 2021 . The Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its two reporting units was less than their respective carrying amounts as of its annual assessment date. The Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either of the Company’s two reporting units had been reduced below their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company concluded that there were no triggering events as of the annual assessment date, December 31, 2021. Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment tests performed during 2020. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis. A decline in the Common Stock price and prices of the Company’s corporate borrowings and the resulting impact on market capitalization are two of several factors considered when making this evaluation. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. Based on sustained declines during the first quarter of 2020 in the Company’s enterprise market capitalization and the temporary suspension of operations at all the Company’s theatres on or before March 17, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of March 31, 2020. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units were less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $1,124.9 million and $619.4 million, respectively, were recorded as of March 31, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. Due to the suspension of operations during the second and third quarters of 2020 and the further delay or cancellation of film releases, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2020. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $151.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were recorded as of September 30, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. Due to the further delay or cancellation of film releases and the further suspension of operations in the International markets, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of December 31, 2020. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and the enterprise fair value of the International Theatre reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, goodwill impairment charge of $405.3 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020 for the Company’s International Theatres reporting unit. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and discount rates to be used in determining fair value, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Given the nature of the Company’s business and its recent history, future impairments are possible based upon business conditions, movie release dates, and attendance levels. Other Long-term Assets. Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 — Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable. Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $3.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years , with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years . The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally, the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recorded at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years , which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of food and beverage and digital equipment. Impairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of theatre assets may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value, with the difference recorded as an impairment charge. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets that were impaired: ​

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of long-lived assets of $61.3 million on 77 theatres in the U.S. markets with 805 screens (in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) and $15.9 million on 14 theatres in the International markets with 118 screens (in Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK), which were related to property, net, operating lease right-of-use assets, net, and other long-term assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of long-lived assets of $152.5 million on 101 theatres in the U.S. markets with 1,139 screens (in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming) and $25.4 million on 37 theatres in the International markets with 340 screens (in Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and UK), which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets. For indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Company recorded impairment charges related to the Odeon trade name of $12.5 million and Nordic trade names of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses in the International markets related to equity method investments of $8.6 million in equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $15.9 million within investment expense (income), related to equity interest investments without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method in the U.S. markets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $76.6 million on 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens and an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $7.7 million on 14 theatres with 148 screens in the International markets, which was related to property held and used, operating lease right-of-use assets, and a U.S. property held and not used in other long-term assets. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million within investment expense (income), related to an equity interest investment without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method. Foreign Currency Translation. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings (loss), except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and also the Company’s £ 4.0 million, 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”). If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation or transaction balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Employee Benefit Plans. The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. and Sweden. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan, which was terminated on May 3, 2021 and will be liquidated in 2022, and also a defined contribution plan. The following table sets forth the plans’ benefit obligations and plan assets and the accrued liability for benefit costs included in the consolidated balance sheets: ​

​ The offset to the pension liability is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. For further information, see Note 14—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for pension amounts and activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, net periodic benefit costs (credits) were $(0.9) million, $1.8 million, and $1.7 million, respectively. The non-operating component of net periodic benefit costs is recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, before the Sweden pension benefit plan was frozen, the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost was recorded in general and administrative other.

​ The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: equity securities of 49 %, debt securities of 45 %, and private real estate of 6 %. The International pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation. Investments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2021, for the U.S. investment portfolio, 94 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and 6 % of the investment included pooled separate accounts valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2021, for the International investment portfolio 37 % included mutual funds and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) and 63 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Under the defined contribution plan, the Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, except during the 2020 furlough period, the Company matched 100 % of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3 % and 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of the employee’s eligible compensation. Income and Operating Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance. The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $34.6 million and $32.7 million, respectively. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $37.1 million, $32.8 million, and $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income): ​

​ Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is intended to improve consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis for goodwill. ASU 2019-12 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Government Assistance. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance (“ASU 2021-10”). The amendments in ASU 2021-10 require annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including (1) information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions, (2) the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected by the transactions, and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and (3) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. The annual government assistance disclosure requirements are effective for the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. ​ NOTE 2—REVENUE RECOGNITION ​ Disaggregation of Revenue.

​ Gift Cards and Exchange Tickets. The total amount of non-redeemed gift cards and exchange tickets included in deferred revenues and income as of December 31, 2021 was $322.0 million. This will be recognized as revenues as the gift cards and exchange tickets are redeemed or as the non-redeemed gift card and exchange ticket revenues are recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months . Loyalty Programs. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of deferred revenues allocated to the loyalty programs included in deferred revenues and income was $65.5 million. The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months .

The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. NOTE 3—LEASES The Company received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. In instances where there were no substantive changes to the lease terms, i.e., modifications that resulted in total payments of the modified lease being substantially the same or less than the total payments of the existing lease, the Company elected the relief as provided by the FASB staff related to the accounting for certain lease concessions. The Company elected not to account for these concessions as a lease modification, and therefore the Company has remeasured the related lease liability and right-of-use asset but did not reassess the lease classification or change the discount rate to the current rate in effect upon the remeasurement. The deferred payment amounts have been recorded in the Company’s lease liabilities to reflect the change in the timing of payments. The deferred payment amounts included in current maturities of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Those leases that did not meet the criteria for treatment under the FASB relief were evaluated as lease modifications. The deferred payment amounts included in accounts payable for contractual rent amounts due and not paid are reflected in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accounts payable. In addition, the Company included deferred lease payments in operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of lease remeasurements. A summary of deferred payment amounts related to rent obligations for which payments were deferred to 2022 and future years are provided below:

============================================================

​ Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows: ​

​ Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $382.0 million, $453.2 million, and $413.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. ​ NOTE 5—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ​ The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by reporting unit: ​

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS ​ Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50 % voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2021, include interests in DCIP of 29.0 %, DCDC of 14.6 %, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0 %, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, of 18.3 %, DCM of 50.0 %, and SCC of 10.0 %. The Company also has partnership interests in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50.0 % interest in 57 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. NCM Transactions Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment” or “CUA”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The CUA is computed annually, except that an earlier CUA will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent CUA, will cause a change of 2 % or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a CUA is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s CUA or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s CUA calculated in accordance with the CUA Agreement. In March 2019, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 197,118 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $1.4 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $7.24 on March 14, 2019. In March 2020, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 1,390,566 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $4.8 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $3.46 on March 12, 2020. In March 2021, the NCM CUA resulted in a negative adjustment of 3,012,738 common units for the Company, and therefore, the Company paid NCM cash of $9.2 million and recorded the amount as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold its remaining approximately 1.4 million NCM shares and received net proceeds of $5.7 million, which were recorded in investment expense (income). See Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 — Revenue Recognition for further information regarding CUA and ESA. DCIP Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received cash distribution of $12.2 million from DCIP, which the Company recorded as a reduction to its investment in DCIP. The distribution reduced the Company’s recorded investment below $0 and therefore the Company recorded equity in earnings of $4.0 million to increase its investment to $0 as the Company has not guaranteed any of the liabilities of DCIP. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received distributions from DCIP of digital projectors it had been leasing with an estimated fair value of $125.2 million, which the Company recorded as a reduction to its investment in DCIP. The distribution reduced the Company’s recorded investment below $0 and therefore the Company recorded equity in earnings of $5.1 million to increase its investment to $0 as the Company has not guaranteed any of the liabilities of DCIP. The Company will not record its share of any equity in earnings of DCIP until such time as the excess distribution amount recorded to earnings has been satisfied with prospective earnings from DCIP. AC JV Transactions On December 26, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned 32 % by each of the Founding Members and 4 % by NCM. In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5 % per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments were due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing. The Company paid the sixth and final annual installment related to the promissory note in December 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the “Digital ESAs”) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. SV Holdco (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity.

​ Odeon Secured Debt Odeon Term Loan Facility. On February 15, 2021, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited (“Odeon”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million term loan facility (the “Odeon Term Loan due 2023”) agreement (the “Odeon Term Loan Facility”), by and among Odeon, the subsidiaries of Odeon party thereto, the lenders and other loan parties thereto and Lucid Agency Services Limited as agent and Lucid Trustee Services Limited as security agent. Approximately £ 89.7 million and € 12.8 million of the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility were used to repay in full Odeon’s obligations (including principal, interest, fees and cash collateralized letters of credit) under its then-existing revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of $1.0 million in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Odeon Term Loan Facility has a maturity of August 19, 2023 (2.5 years from the date on which it was first drawn). Borrowings under the Odeon Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to 10.75 % per annum during the first year and 11.25 % thereafter and each interest period is 3 months , or such other period agreed between the Company and the Agent. The interest is capitalized on the last day of each interest period and added to the outstanding principal amount, however, Odeon has the option to elect to pay interest in cash. For the first interest period ending May 2021 and the second interest period ending August 2021, Odeon elected to pay in PIK interest. Odeon paid cash interest with respect to the third interest period ending November 2021. The principal amount of new funding is prior to deducting discounts of $19.4 million and deferred financing costs of $16.5 million related to the Odeon Term Loan Facility. The discount and deferred financing costs will be amortized to interest expense over the term using the effective interest method. All obligations under the Odeon Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Odeon. The Company is subject to minimum liquidity requirements of £ 32.5 million (approximately $44 million) required under the Odeon Term Loan Facility, measured at each quarter end date. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“Odeon Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders made available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £ 100.0 million. The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility was 2.5 % plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee was 0.5 % of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales were pledged as collateral. On April 24, 2020, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited entered into an amendment to the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility with Lloyds Bank PLC as agent (the “Odeon Amendment”), pursuant to the requisite lenders thereunder granted a waiver of the maintenance covenant thereunder for the period from and after the effective date of the Odeon Amendment to and including the earlier of (a) March 31, 2021 and (b) the day immediately preceding the last day of the Relevant Period (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) during which Odeon Cinemas Group Limited has delivered a Financial Covenant Election (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) to the agent (the “Odeon Covenant Suspension Period”). During the Odeon Covenant Suspension Period, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, make certain restricted payments including payment on shareholder loans, provided that cash payments of interest with respect to shareholder loans will be permitted. Additionally, lenders granted a waiver such that certain events or circumstances resulting from COVID-19 virus occurring prior to the Odeon Amendment and continuing will be deemed not to constitute an event of default under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. On February 15, 2021, Odeon used the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility to repay in full its then-existing Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. First Lien Toggle Notes Due 2026 On January 15, 2021, the Company issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 15 %/ 17 % Cash/PIK Toggle First Lien Secured Notes due 2026 (the “First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026”) as contemplated by the previously disclosed commitment letter with Mudrick Capital Management, LP (“Mudrick”), dated as of December 10, 2020. The First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of January 15, 2021 among the Company, the guarantors named therein and the U.S. bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. On September 30, 2021, the Company exercised an option to repurchase $35.0 million of its First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026. The total cost to exercise this repurchase option was $40.3 million, including principal, redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of this debt reduction, the Company’s annual cash interest cost will be reduced by $5.25 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded loss on debt extinguishment of $14.4 million in other expense. See Note 16—Subsequent Events for additional information. The First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 bear cash interest at a rate of 15 % per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, beginning on July 15, 2021. Interest for the first three interest periods after the issue date may, at the Company’s option, be paid in PIK interest at a rate of 17 % per annum, and thereafter interest shall be payable solely in cash. For the first interest period ended July 15, 2021, the Company elected to pay in PIK interest. The First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 will mature on April 24, 2026. The indenture provides that the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 are general senior secured obligations of the Company and are secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the First Lien Notes due 2026, and the First Lien Notes due 2025.

Mudrick exchanged $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 that were held by Mudrick for the Exchange Shares (the “Second Lien Exchange”) and waived its claim to PIK interest of $4.5 million principal amount. The fair value of 21,978,022 shares of the Company’s Common Stock was $70.1 million based on the market closing price of $3.19 per share on December 14, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the common shares issued were recorded by the Company in stockholders’ deficit. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reclassified the prepaid commitment fee and deferred charges of $28.6 million to corporate borrowings from other long-term assets for the Commitment Shares and deferred charges. The prepaid commitment fee was recorded as a discount and, together with deferred charges, will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 of $93.6 million based on the fair value of the Exchange Shares of $43.8 million and the carrying value of the $104.5 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes exchanged of $137.4 million. The Company filed a shelf registration statement in December 2020, which was declared effective providing for the resale of the Exchange Shares. Senior Subordinated Debt Exchange Offers On July 31, 2020, the Company consummated its previously announced private offers to exchange (the “Exchange Offers”) any and all of its outstanding 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, 5.75 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025, 5.875 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 and 6.125 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 (together the “Existing Subordinated Notes”) for newly issued Second Lien Notes due 2026. The aggregate principal amounts of the Existing Subordinated Notes set forth in the table below were validly tendered and subsequently accepted. Such accepted Existing Subordinated Notes were retired and cancelled. ​

============================================================

​ The Exchange Offers reduced the principal amounts of the Company’s debt by approximately $555 million, which represented approximately 23.9 % of the principal amount of the Existing Subordinated Notes. The Company raised $300 million in additional cash from the issuance of the new First Lien Notes due 2026, prior to deducting $36 million related to discounts and deferred financing costs paid to the lenders. Additionally, certain holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes that agreed to backstop the rights offering for $200 million of the First Lien Notes due 2026 received five million common shares, or 4.6 % of AMC’s outstanding shares as of July 31, 2020, worth $20.2 million at the market closing price on July 31, 2020. The closing of the Exchange Offers also allowed the Company to extend maturities on approximately $1.7 billion of debt to 2026, most of which was maturing in 2024 and 2025 previously. Interest due for 12 to 18 months after issuance on the Second Lien Notes due 2026 is expected to be paid all or in part on an in-kind basis, thereby generating a further near-term cash savings for the Company of between approximately $120 million and $180 million. The Company realized $1.2 billion of cancellation of debt income (“CODI”) for tax purposes in connection with its debt restructuring. As a result of such CODI, $1.2 billion of its net operating losses were eliminated as a result of tax attribute reductions, see Note 10 — Income Taxes for further information. In connection with the Exchange Offers, the Company also received consents from eligible holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes to amend the indentures governing the Existing Subordinated Notes to among other things, (i) release the existing subsidiary guarantees of the Existing Subordinated Notes, (ii) eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain affirmative covenants and certain events of default contained in the indentures governing the Existing Subordinated Notes, and (iii) make other conforming changes to internally conform to certain proposed amendments. The Company performed an assessment on a lender-by-lender basis to identify certain lenders that met the criteria for a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors (“ASC 470-60”) as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and the lenders granted a concession. The portion of the loans that did not meet the assessment of TDR under ASC 470-60 were treated as modifications. The Company accounted for the exchange of approximately $1,782.5 million principal amount of its Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $1,289.1 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as TDR. The Company accounted for the exchange of the remaining approximately $235.0 million principal amount of its Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $173.2 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as a modification of debt as the lenders did not grant a concession and the difference between the present value of the old and new cash flows was less than 10 %. The TDR and modification did not result in a gain recognition and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the Existing Subordinated Notes and recorded the new fees paid to third parties of approximately $39.3 million in other expense, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Second Lien Notes due 2026. In connection with the Second Lien Exchange on December 14, 2020, Mudrick exchanged $104.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Second Lien Notes due 2026 held by Mudrick for 13,736,264 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, see “First Lien Toggle Notes Due 2026” above for further information. In connection with the Exchange Offers on July 31, 2020, the Company issued $1,462.3 million aggregate principal amount of the new Second Lien Notes due 2026 in exchange for the Existing Subordinated Notes. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company has reflected a premium of $535.1 million on the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as the difference between the principal balance of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 and the $1,997.4 million carrying value of the Existing Subordinated Notes exchanged. The premium will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. In connection with the Exchange Offers and the First Lien Notes due 2026, the Company issued five million shares of Common Stock to certain holders of subordinated notes as consideration for their commitment to backstop the issuance of $200 million of the First Lien Notes due 2026. Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Agreement dated July 10, 2020, certain of the actual or beneficial holders of Existing Subordinated Notes agreed to purchase 100 % of the First Lien Notes due 2026 that were not subscribed for in connection with the $200 million rights offering to holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes participating in the Exchange Offers. Those providing a backstop commitment pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Agreement received their pro-rata share of five million shares of the Common Stock, or 4.6 % of AMC’s outstanding shares as of July 31, 2020, worth $20.2 million at the market closing price on July 31, 2020. The equity issuance was recorded by the Company in stockholders’ deficit with an offset in corporate borrowings as a discount. The discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. As part of the registration rights agreement related to the issuance of the Common Stock, the Company filed a shelf registration statement in August 2020 providing for the resale of the shares of Common Stock issued as consideration for the backstop commitment described above. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 bear cash interest at a rate of 10 % per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, beginning on December 15, 2020. Subject to the limitation in the next succeeding sentence, interest for the first three interest periods after the issue date may, at the Company’s option, be paid in PIK interest at a rate of 12 % per annum. For the first interest period ending December 15, 2020 and the second interest period ending June 15, 2021, the Company elected to pay in PIK interest. For the third interest period ending December 15, 2021, the Company paid cash interest with respect to the third interest period. For all interest periods after the first three interest periods, interest will be payable solely in cash at a rate of 10 % per annum. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 are redeemable at the Company’s option prior to June 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of their aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest, plus an applicable make-whole premium. On or after June 15, 2023, the Second Lien Notes due 2026 will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) 106.0 % for the twelve-month period beginning on June 15, 2023; (ii) 103.0 % for the twelve-month period beginning on June 15, 2024 and (iii) 100.0 % at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

As an ongoing condition to the suspension of the financial covenant, the Company agreed to a minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Seventh Amendment) test, which was amended by the Ninth Amendment. In addition, the Seventh Amendment provides for certain changes to the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens and restricted payments that are intended to match corresponding restrictions under the 10.5 % first lien notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Notes due 2025”) and to ensure that the terms and conditions of the First Lien Notes due 2025 (subject to certain exceptions) are not materially more favorable (when taken as a whole) to the noteholders than the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (when taken as a whole) are to the lenders thereunder.

Concurrently with the Exchange Offers, to obtain the consent of the holders of the 2.95 % Convertible Notes due 2024 (the “Convertible Notes due 2024”) to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Offers, the Company restructured $600 million of Convertible Notes due 2024 issued in 2018 to Silver Lake and others pursuant to which the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 was extended to May 1, 2026 (the “Convertible Notes due 2026”) (the “Convertible Notes” means the Convertible Notes due 2024 before July 31, 2020 and the Convertible Notes due 2026 after July 31, 2020), a first-priority lien on the Collateral was granted to secure indebtedness thereunder and certain covenants were modified. The Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an amended and restated indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company accounted for this transaction as a modification of debt as the lenders did not grant a concession and the difference between the present value of the old and new cash flows was less than 10 %. The modification did not result in the recognition of any gain or loss and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the Convertible Notes due 2024. Third party costs related to the transaction were expensed as incurred and amounts paid to lenders were capitalized and amortized through maturity of the debt. The Convertible Notes due 2026 are convertible at the option of the holders thereof on the same terms as the Convertible Notes due 2024. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2026 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2026 at 2.95 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15 th and March 15 th , commencing on September 15, 2020.

The non-cash Conversion settled on January 29, 2021, and resulted in the issuance of 44,422,860 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the Noteholders. The Company recorded approximately $71.0 million of non-cash interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 for unamortized discount and deferred charges at the date of conversion following the guidance in ASC 815-15-40-1. The non-cash Conversion reduced the Company’s first-lien indebtedness by $600.0 million. Pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement with Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”) dated as of September 14, 2018, 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda were forfeited and cancelled in connection with the Conversion.

​ On April 24, 2020, the Company entered into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the Convertible Notes due 2024 indenture, dated as of September 14, 2018. The Supplemental Indenture amended the debt covenant under the Convertible Notes due 2024 Indenture to permit the Company to issue the First Lien Notes due 2025, among other changes. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95 % Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 to Silver Lake and others. The Convertible Notes due 2024 would have matured on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. On September 14, 2018, the Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature was not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price caused the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone met the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 were not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and was amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98 % over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company recorded interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 of $0 million, $31.8 million, and $32.6 million, respectively. The derivative liability was remeasured at fair value each reporting period, a Level 3 fair value estimate, until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as other expense or income. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the derivative liability as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the conversion feature is indexed to the Company’s equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded in other expense (income) of $89.4 million and $(23.5) million, respectively, related to the derivative liability fair value adjustments for embedded conversion feature in the Convertible Notes due 2024. Pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement between the Company and Wanda, the conversion feature of the Convertible Notes due 2024 would result in 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda being subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost. This cancellation agreement was a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which was a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which was a Level 3 estimate of fair value. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million was offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature was not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 host and it was bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period until the conversion feature reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as other expense or income. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, this resulted in other expense (income) of $19.6 million and $17.7 million, respectively, related to the derivative asset fair value adjustment for contingent call option related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation agreement. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the derivative asset as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the number of shares that will be cancelled on conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2024 were known. The Company recorded an immaterial non-cash correction of $26.2 million recorded in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. The adjustment related to the Company correcting the valuation methodology applied to the derivative asset related to the cancellation agreement entered into on September 14, 2018, a Level 3 estimate of fair value for a complex instrument developed in consultation with a third party specialist.

The Company currently expects it will be able to comply with this financial covenant, however, the Company does not anticipate the need to borrow under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility during the next twelve months.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in a covenant suspension period under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility as described above. ​ NOTE 9—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY ​ Common Stock Rights and Privileges ​ Holders of Holdings’ Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share.

● Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement: 2021 PSU Awards. On February 23, 2021, total PSUs of 2,687,813 were awarded (“2021 PSU award”) to certain members of management and executive officers, with the total PSUs divided into three separate year tranches, with each tranche allocated to a fiscal year within the performance period (“Tranche Year”).

No PSUs will vest for each Tranche Year if the Company does not achieve 80% of the Tranche Year’s Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow targets.
============================================================

On November 3, 2021, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the PSUs for the awards granted in 2021 and 2020. The service condition modification included separating the vesting period subject to the participant’s continued employment through the end of the three-year cumulative period into three separate year service periods applicable to each tranche year. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as a Type I modification (probable-to-probable) with no change to the fair value measurement of the awards. 2020 PSU Awards: During the year ended December 31, 2020, PSU awards of 1,436,297 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2022, prior to the service condition and performance condition modifications on November 3, 2021 and October 30, 2020, respectively. 2019 PSU Awards: During the year ended December 31, 2019, PSU awards of 730,167 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2021, prior to the service condition and performance condition modifications on November 3, 2021 and October 30, 2020, respectively. 2018 PSU Awards: During the year ended December 31, 2018, PSU awards of 653,669 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020, prior to the performance condition modification on October 30, 2020.

Due to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, the Board of Directors waived attainment of the 2020 tranche year performance targets and established a vesting level for such PSUs at 90 %. In addition, the service conditions were modified, and vesting is now subject to the participant’s continued employment through the end of the three-year cumulative period. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as an exchange of the original award, that was not expected to vest, for a new award. The Company measured the fair value of the new award on the modification date, October 30, 2020, because the Company determined that achieving performance thresholds were probable for certain tranche awards. 2017 PSU Awards: During the year ended December 31, 2017, PSU awards were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019. The performance conditions were not met as of December 31, 2019 and the Company reversed previously recorded expense of $5.8 million on these units during the year ended December 31, 2019.

● Special Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2019, a PSU market condition award of 300,000 was granted to an executive officer of the Company that would vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Common Stock. This award was subsequently cancelled and replaced with the PSU market condition award granted on February 26, 2020.
============================================================

On February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020, special performance stock unit awards (“SPSUs”), totaling 3,570,000 units were granted to certain executive officers that will vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Class Common Stock. The SPSUs are eligible to vest in tranches contingent upon (i) the attainment of certain 20 trading day volume weighted average closing prices and (ii) fulfillment of the three-year service requirement from the date of grant. The vested SPSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting. Any unvested SPSUs remaining after 10 years will be forfeited. If service is terminated prior to the three year anniversary from the date of grant, unvested SPSUs shall be forfeited. The target prices and vesting tranches are set forth in the table below: ​

============================================================

============================================================

​ The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the SPSUs. This model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the SPSUs: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assumptions Expected stock price volatility ​ 45.0 % Expected dividend yield ​ 2.02 % and 2.44 % Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.33 % and 0.92 % Grant-date stock price ​ $5.93 and $4.92
============================================================

​ The expected stock price volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equivalent to the derived service period. The expected dividend yield is based on annual expected dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate was based on the treasury yield rates as of the date of grant for a period equivalent to the performance measurement period. The fair value of each SPSU is amortized over the requisite or derived service period, which is up to 6.4 years. The SPSUs granted on February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020 have a grant date fair value of approximately $12.2 million. On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the SPSUs for the awards. Each SPSU award agreement was amended as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● The stock price thresholds (ranging from $12 to $24) and service requirement for tranches 1 through 4 of the SPSUs were eliminated and such SPSUs vested on October 30, 2020;

============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● The service requirement for tranches 5 and 6 was shortened to end on October 30, 2021.
============================================================

As a result of the SPSU modification of market conditions, the incremental fair value amount assigned to the grant date fair value was approximately $7.3 million in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation. In January 2021, the market condition requirement for SPSUs was met as a result of exceeding the 20-day trailing volume weighted average stock price threshold target for tranche 5 and tranche 6 of $4 and $8 , respectively. The stock-based compensation costs for SPSUs were recorded on a straight-line basis through October 30, 2021, which was the end of the service requirement period.

​ ​ NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods on a federal, state and foreign jurisdiction basis. The Company conducts its evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. motion picture and broader economy, among others. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 for each taxing jurisdiction. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections of future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period for the U.S. and international jurisdictions, with the exception of Norway and Finland. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets as well as international jurisdictions in which it operates, with the exception of Finland and Norway. During the first quarter of 2020, the severe impact of COVID-19 on operations in Germany and Spain caused the Company to conclude the realizability of deferred tax assets held in those jurisdictions does not meet the more likely than not standard. As such, a charge of $33.1 million and $40.1 million was recorded for Germany and Spain, respectively. Cancellation of Debt Income. On July 31, 2020, the Company consummated previously announced private offers to exchange its Existing Subordinated Notes for newly issued Second Lien Notes due 2026. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. For US tax purposes the Company was required to recognize CODI on the difference between the face value of debt exchanged and the fair market value of the new debt issued. The Company recognized $1.2 billion of CODI for tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2020. IRS §108 provides relief from recognizing CODI as current taxable income to the extent that the tax paying legal entity is insolvent as defined by the US Tax Code. The Company determined that the level of its insolvency at July 31, 2020 exceeded the indicated amount of CODI resulting from the debt exchange. To the extent that an entity is insolvent, rather than recognize current taxable income, the entity may reduce its tax attributes including net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits, depreciable assets, investment in subsidiaries and other investments in the amount of the excluded CODI. The Company determined that $1.2 billion of its federal net operating losses would be eliminated as a result of the tax attribute reduction. The actual effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 0.8 %. The Company’s consolidated tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, foreign tax rate differences, and federal and state tax credits, partially offset by state income taxes and permanent differences related to interest, compensation, and other discrete items. No tax impact was recorded on the $2,306.4 million goodwill impairment charge incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the portion impaired was permanently non-deductible. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $30.7 million and of $40.2 million, respectively. Cares Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property, as well as loans to certain qualifying businesses. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not participated in CARES Act loans.

The Company has federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1,185.5 million. Approximately $320.6 million will begin to expire in 2022, and will completely expire in 2036, and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $864.9 million can be used indefinitely. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $898.4 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $10.8 million, which will expire in various amounts between years 2022 and 2033. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $1,678.6 million. Approximately $1,192.4 million may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years .

​ The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense or penalties related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The Company analyzed and reviewed state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $0.6 million of interest expense and $0.4 million of penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million of interest expense and $0.5 million of penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $0 and $1.6 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $0.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $0.2 million of its unrecognized tax positions related to state taxes may be recognized by the end of 2022 as a result of settlements or the expiration of statute of limitations. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 was settled in 2021 resulting in additional federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”). Generally, tax years beginning after December 31, 2001 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has NOL carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2021, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforward and other tax attributes became subject to the Section 382 ownership change limitation due to changes in our stock ownership on January 29, 2021. Management believes the Company’s ability to utilize these tax attributes has not been significantly limited by this event. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions. On January 22, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On September 23, 2019, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On March 2, 2020, plaintiffs moved to certify the purported class. On March 30, 2021, the court granted the motion to certify the class. On September 2, 2021, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the Actions for $18.0 million. The Company agreed to the settlement and the payment of the settlement amount to eliminate the distraction, burden, expense, and uncertainty of further litigation. The Company and the other defendants continue to expressly deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the matters alleged in the Actions. On November 1, 2021, the parties to the Actions signed a stipulation of settlement, which memorialized the terms of the agreement in principle, and which the plaintiffs filed with the court. Also on November 1, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to preliminarily approve the settlement. On November 8, 2021, the court preliminarily approved the settlement, approved the form of notice to be disseminated to class members, and scheduled a final fairness hearing on the settlement for February 10, 2022. On February 14, 2022, the court issued a final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the action. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. On October 2, 2019, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Kenna v. Aron , et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-09148-AJN (the “Kenna Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on October 17, 2019. On April 20, 2020, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The Kenna Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 21D of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions and the Gantulga Action. The stay was lifted as of February 9, 2022. On March 20, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Manuel v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02456-AJN (the “Manuel Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Manuel Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 21D, and 29(b) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, and the Kenna Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on May 18, 2020. On April 7, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Dinkevich v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02870-AJN (the “Dinkevich Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Dinkevich Action asserts the same claims as the Manuel Action based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, the Kenna Action, and the Manuel Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which was granted on June 25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, the court lifted the stay. On September 23, 2021, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Lyon v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:21-cv-07940-AJN (the “Lyon Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors. The Lyon Action asserts claims for contribution and indemnification under the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment/constructive trust based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, the Kenna Action, the Manuel Action, and the Dinkevich Action. On January 14, 2022, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On December 31, 2019, the Company received a stockholder litigation demand, requesting that the Board investigate the allegations in the Actions and pursue claims on the Company’s behalf based on those allegations. On May 5, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On July 15, 2020, the Company received a second stockholder litigation demand requesting substantially the same action as the stockholder demand it received on December 31, 2019. On September 23, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. , et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of Common Stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On January 8, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the court recommending that the court dismiss all of the claims asserted in the Lao Action, and moved to dismiss all of the claims in the Lao Action. The court has not yet ruled on the Special Litigation Committee’s motion to dismiss. ​ NOTE 12—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ​ Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ​

​ Valuation Techniques. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate discount rates to be used in determining fair value, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Such judgments and estimates include estimates of future attendance, revenues, cash flows, rent relief, cost savings, capital expenditures, and the cost of capital, among others. At December 31, 2021, related cash flows were discounted at 10.0 % for the Domestic Theatres and 11.5 % for the International Theatres, at December 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 11.0 % for Domestic Theatres and 12.5 % for International Theatres, at September 30, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.0 % for Domestic Theatres and 13.0 % for International Theatres, and at March 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 11.5 % for Domestic Theatres and 13.0 % for International Theatres. The Company used a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 %, except for the March 31, 2020 measurement date, which the Company used a long-term growth rate input of 2.0 %. These estimates determine whether impairments have been incurred and quantify the amount of any related impairment charge. To estimate fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived trade names, the Company employed a derivation of the Income Approach known as the Royalty Savings Method. The Royalty Savings Method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. The Company applied royalty rates of 0.5 % for AMC and Odeon trade names and 1.0 % for Nordic trade names to the related theatre revenues on an after-tax basis using effective tax rates. At December 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.0 % for AMC and 13.5 % for Odeon and Nordic, at September 30, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 13.0 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic, and at March 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.5 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic. The Company performed the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. In calculating the fair value of our Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units by use the income approach for enterprise valuation methodology, which utilizes discounted cash flows. The income approach provides an estimate of fair value by measuring estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period and applying a present value discount rate to the cash flows. The present value of the cash flows is then added to the present value equivalent of the residual value of the business to arrive at an estimated fair value of the reporting unit. At December 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 11.0 % for Domestic Theatres and 12.5 % for International Theatres, at September 30, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.0 % for Domestic Theatres and 13.0 % for International Theatres, and at March 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 11.5 % for Domestic Theatres and 13.0 % for International Theatres. The Company used a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 %, except for the March 31, 2020 measurement date, which the Company used a long-term growth rate input of 2.0 %.

The following tables summarize the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value: ​

​ Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for Level 2 inputs. The Level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under estimated market conditions. The Company valued these notes at principal value less an estimated discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. ​ ​ NOTE 13—OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting, which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. The Company has identified two reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia. The Company divested of its interest in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania operations, see Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information on the Baltics theatre sale. Operations located in Austria were sold during the first quarter of 2019. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees and other loyalty programs, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: ​

============================================================

​ Vested RSUs, PSUs, and SPSUs have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Common Stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, unvested RSUs of 2,247,625 , 1,131,333 , and 1,377,992 , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would be anti-dilutive. Unvested PSUs and SPSUs are subject to performance and market conditions, respectively, and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. Unvested PSUs of 0 , 649,209 and 477,630 for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, and unvested SPSUs of 578,328 at the minimum market condition for the year ended December 31, 2020, were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or they would be anti-dilutive. On January 29, 2021, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Company’s Convertible Notes due 2026 were converted into the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $13.51 per share and resulted in the issuance of 44,422,860 shares. For both the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company used the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has not adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to eliminate the interest expense of $31.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and the loss (gain) for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes of $89.4 million and $(23.5) million, respectively, in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. The Company has not included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 35.5 million and 31.7 million shares issuable upon conversion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the effects would be anti-dilutive. ​ ​ NOTE 16— SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ​ First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2029. On February 14, 2022, the Company issued $950.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.5 % First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (“First Lien Notes due 2029”). The First Lien Notes due 2029 bear cash interest at a rate of 7.5 % per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2022. The First Lien Notes due 2029 are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities and existing secured notes. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes, and cash on hand, to fund the full redemption of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2025, the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2026, and $73.5 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 and to pay related accrued interest, fees, costs, premiums and expenses. The Company estimates it will record a loss on debt extinguishment related to this transaction of approximately $135 million in other expense in 2022. ​ ​

With management’s participation, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December 31, 2020, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report that follows this report. ​

​ ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

​ ​ Goodwill Impairment ​ Description of the Matter ​ The Company assigns goodwill acquired in business combinations to its reporting units as of each acquisition date. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill balance related to the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was approximately $1.797 billion and $751 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized impairments of $1.276 billion and $1.030 billion to the Domestic Theatre and International Theatre reporting units, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Auditing management’s goodwill impairment assessments for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate and projected future revenues which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the prospective financial information (PFI) for the quantitative analysis. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the valuation was complete and accurate. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by the Company to current industry and economic trends, including the impact of COVID-19, while also considering changes to the Company’s business model, forecasts used in the Company’s annual operating plans and other relevant factors. In addition, we evaluated the competency and objectivity of management's qualified persons and third-party specialists through consideration of their professional qualifications, experience, objectivity, and their use of accepted industry practices. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the Company’s significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates. We reconciled the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount, testing the Company’s determination of the assets and liabilities used within the reporting units that are the basis for the carrying amount.

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Liquidity – Impact of COVID-19 ​ Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to the global pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended all theatre operations in its U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of the Company’s guests and theatre staff. The Company resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal government restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. The North American and International industry box offices have also have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, and in response to the suspension of theatre operations by the Company and other theatre exhibitors and the COVID-19 related suspension of new movie production, studios have postponed new film releases beyond 2020 or moved them to the home video market. As a result of these temporarily suspended operations and limited new film content, the Company’s revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 are significantly lower than the revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management determined that the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on their operations will continue to have a material negative impact on their financial results and liquidity. Management has taken

============================================================
actions to improve the Company’s liquidity, including reductions to the Company’s fixed cost structure, negotiating deferrals and/or abatements of theatre rent, and the execution of capital market transactions including debt issuances, debt exchanges and equity sales. Based on these actions and considering the Company’s available liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $308 million at December 31, 2020, management concluded there is sufficient liquidity to meet minimum liquidity requirements, fund operations, and satisfy the Company’s obligations for at least the next twelve months. The principal assumptions used in management’s cash flow analyses used to estimate future liquidity requirements consisted of: the continued vaccine rollout; release and supply of Hollywood theatrical product; the expected increase in attendance levels; and the impacts of home video or streaming markets. We determined the Company’s assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment by management when evaluating the uncertainty related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s financial results and liquidity. In particular, there is a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s liquidity assessment to determine that the Company will be able to satisfy its obligations as they become due for 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested controls over the Company’s going concern assessment process. For example, we tested controls involving management’s review of significant assumptions in the liquidity analysis. Further, we tested management’s process for forecasting financial results and liquidity for one year after the date the financial statements are issued and tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the forecast. We independently assessed the sensitivity and impact of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and estimates included in management’s cash flow forecasts and liquidity position and compared those results to the sensitivity analyses performed by management. We evaluated management’s disclosure in the consolidated financial statements that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations for at least the next twelve months.

​ ​ ​ ​ Valuation of operating lease liabilities Description of the Matter ​ At December 31, 2020, the Company’s operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities were $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. As discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) for operating leases. Since most of the leases do not provide a determinable implicit rate, the Company estimated its IBR used to calculate its right of use assets and lease liabilities. Auditing the Company’s estimate of the IBR was especially challenging as it involved a high degree of subjective judgment when testing the reasonableness of the inputs and appropriateness of the rates applied to each lease. In particular, the estimate of the IBR is sensitive to significant assumptions such as determination of current credit rating and selection of associated yield curve. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination of the IBR. For example, we tested management’s review controls over this process. To test the Company’s determination of the IBR, our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of management’s methodology for developing the IBR and a comparison of certain assumptions used by management to our independent estimates which were developed with the assistance of our specialists. ​ ​ ​

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Kansas City, Missouri March 12, 2021 ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

​ ​ See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ​ ​ ​ AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 201 8 ​ NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2020, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate, owned approximately 23.08 % of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 47.37 % of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and had significant influence over Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. On February 1, 2021, Wanda exercised their right to convert all outstanding Class B common stock to Class A common stock resulting in ownership in Holdings’ outstanding common stock and voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock of approximately 9.8 % as of March 3, 2021. Temporarily Suspended Operations. As of March 17, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended all theatre operations in its U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of the Company’s guests and theatre staff. The Company resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal government restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. The North American and International industry box offices have also have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, and in response to the suspension of theatre operations by the Company and other theatre exhibitors and the COVID-19 related suspension of new movie production, studios have postponed new film releases beyond 2020 or moved them to the home video market. As a result of these temporarily suspended operations and limited new film content, the Company’s revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 are significantly lower than the revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Liquidity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken and continues to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, including reductions to the Company’s variable and elements of its fixed cost structure, including, but not limited to:

● The February 2021 entry into a new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million term loan facility agreement (the “Odeon Term Loan Facility”) by Odeon Cinemas Group Limited (“Odeon”). Approximately £ 89.7 million and € 12.8 million of the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility was used to repay in full Odeon’s obligations (including principal, interest, fees and cash collateralized letters of credit) under its existing revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes .
============================================================

If attendance levels increase consistent with our assumptions described below, it currently estimates that its existing cash and cash equivalents, net proceeds from the completed issuances of debt and common stock in January 2021 and borrowings under the Odeon Term Loan Facility in February 2021 will be sufficient to comply with minimum liquidity requirements under our debt covenants, fund operations, and satisfy obligations including cash outflows for increased rent and planned capital expenditures currently and through at least March 31, 2022. This requires that the Company achieves significant increases in attendance levels beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and ultimately reaching 90 % of pre COVID-19 attendance levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 and through the first quarter of 2022, as the vaccine rollout continues and more Hollywood product is released in its theatres. The Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (as defined below) to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the suspension period for the financial covenant applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein. As a result, the Company will be subject to the financial covenant beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2022. The Company is subject to minimum liquidity requirements of approximately $145 million of which $100 million is required under the conditions for the Extended Covenant Suspension Period under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility during the Extended Covenant Suspension Period, as amended, and £ 32.5 million (approximately $45 million) required under the Odeon Term Loan Facility. The Company’s liquidity needs thereafter will depend, among other things, on the timing of a full resumption of operations, the timing of movie releases and its ability to generate cash from operations. The Company continues to explore potential sources of additional liquidity, which is essential to its long-term viability, including:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Additional equity financing. The Company may continue to pursue equity issuances that include its remaining authorized shares. The amount of liquidity the Company might generate will primarily depend on the market price of its Class A common stock, trading volumes, which impact the number of shares the Company is able to sell, and the available periods during which sales may be made. Because the Company’s market price and trading volumes are volatile, there is no guarantee as to the amounts of liquidity it might generate or that its prior experience accurately predicts the results the Company will achieve.

● Landlord Negotiations . Commencing in 2021, the Company’s cash expenditures for rent are scheduled to increase significantly as a result of rent obligations that had been deferred to 2021 and future years that were approximately $450.0 million as of December 31, 2020. In light of the Company’s liquidity challenges, and in order to establish its long-term viability, the Company believes it must continue to reach accommodations with its landlords to abate or defer a substantial portion of the Company’s rent obligations, in addition to generating sufficient amounts of liquidity through equity issuances and the other potential financing arrangements discussed below. Accordingly, the Company has entered into additional landlord negotiations to seek material reductions, abatements and deferrals in its rent obligations. In connection with these negotiations, the Company has ceased to make rent payments under a portion of its leases and has received notices of default, the result of which may permit landlords to threaten or seek a variety of remedies. The Company continues to renegotiate leases with landlords to attain additional concessions and address any instances of default. To the extent the Company achieves substantial deferrals but not abatements, its cash requirements will increase substantially in the future.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Other Creditor Discussions . While the liquidity the Company has raised has substantially extended its liquidity runway, the new debt the Company has issued or that has been committed, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase its leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like the Company’s deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to its long-term viability if its operating income does not return to pre-COVID levels. Even then, the Company believes it will need to engage in discussions with its creditors to substantially reduce its leverage. The Company expects to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage its leverage but would be dilutive to holders of its common stock. The Company expects it will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.

============================================================

It is very difficult to estimate the Company’s liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates and future attendance levels. Depending on the Company’s assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve more normalized levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when theatre attendance levels will normalize, which the Company expects will depend on the widespread availability and use of effective vaccines for the coronavirus. However, the Company’s current cash burn rates are not sustainable. Further, the Company cannot predict what future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition once moviegoers are prepared to return in large numbers. Nor can the Company know with certainty the impact of Warner Bros.’s announcement that it is releasing its entire 2021 slate of movies on HBO Max at the same time as the movies debut in theatres or any similar announcements regarding the release of movie titles concurrently to the home video or streaming markets, as those arrangements will be subject to negotiations that have not yet taken place. There can be no assurance that the attendance level and other assumptions used to estimate the Company’s liquidity requirements and future cash burn will be correct, and its ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet its obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to maintain or renegotiate its minimum liquidity covenant requirements, it could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company also realized significant cancellation of debt income (“CODI”) in connection with its debt restructuring. As a result of such CODI, the Company estimates a significant portion of its net operating losses and tax credits will be eliminated as a result of tax attribute reductions. Any loss of tax attributes as a result of such CODI may adversely affect the Company’s cash flows and therefore its ability to service its indebtedness. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Noncontrolling Interests. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. On August 28, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU, which consists of nine theatres located in the Baltics’ region (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and is included in the Company’s International markets reportable segment, for total consideration of approximately € 77.25 million, including cash of approximately € 64.35 million or $76.6 million prior to any transaction costs. This transaction was undertaken by the Company to further increase its liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet at a transaction multiple that demonstrates that market participants ascribe positive value to the business. The completion of the sale will take place in several steps and is contingent upon clearance from each regulatory competition council in each country. The Company received $37.5 million (€ 31.53 million) cash consideration upon entering into the sale agreement on August 28, 2020, transferred an equity interest of 49 % in Forum Cinemas OU to the purchaser and recorded an initial noncontrolling interest of $34.9 million in total equity (deficit). Transaction costs of $1.4 million and net gain of $1.2 million related to the sale of 49 % equity interest of Lithuania and Estonia and the 100 % disposal of Latvia were recorded in additional paid-in capital during the year ended December 31, 2020 and will be recognized in earnings when the remaining 51 % interests in Lithuania and Estonia are disposed. At December 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group that were previously included in the International markets reportable segment were; goodwill of $41.8 million, property, net, of $13.0 million, operating lease right-of-use assets, net of $15.7 million, and current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $2.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. The remaining cash consideration is payable upon completion of the sale of the remaining 51 % equity interest in Lithuania and Estonia, which is expected to occur in two separate transactions by country following competition council clearance in each country. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s noncontrolling interest of 49 % in Lithuania and Estonia was $26.9 million. The Company estimates the sale of Forum Cinemas will be completed in 2021. Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recorded at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100 % of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 13 % to 18.5 % of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The Company believes it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. Film Exhibition Costs. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded film payables of $16.4 million and $166.5 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Food and Beverage Costs. The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement. The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”) with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 — Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5 % to 18.25 %, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. Customer Engagement Programs. AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program in the U.S. markets which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs ® Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. The Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. AMC Stubs ® A-List is the Company’s monthly subscription-based tier of the AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies for $19.95 and $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $10.7 million, $42.6 million, and $45.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents. All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability. The Company remeasured the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B common stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense (income). The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other expense (income) related to derivative asset fair value adjustments of $19.6 million, $17.7 million and $(45.0) million, during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and other expense (income) related to derivative liability fair value adjustments of $89.4 million, $(23.5) million, and $(66.4) million, during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations and Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity for further discussions. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets were recorded at fair value for intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $15.2 million in the International markets. There were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Investments. The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment expense (income). Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 — Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2020, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.3 % interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50.0 % interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0 % interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6 % interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 10.0 % interest in SCC; a 50 % ownership interest in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50 % ownership interest in 54 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. In 2020, the Company early adopted the amendments in S-X Rule 1-02(w) related to significant subsidiary tests of nonconsolidated entities. Goodwill. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $2,547.3 million and $4,789.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company evaluates goodwill recorded at the Company’s two reporting units (Domestic Theatres and International Theatres). Also, the Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment test for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A decline in the common stock price and prices of the Company’s corporate borrowings and the resulting impact on market capitalization are two of several factors considered when making this evaluation. Based on sustained declines during the first quarter of 2020 in the Company’s enterprise market capitalization and the temporary suspension of operations at all the Company’s theatres on or before March 17, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of March 31, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units were less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $1,124.9 million and $619.4 million, respectively, were recorded as of March 31, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of September 30, 2020. Due to the suspension of operations during the second and third quarters of 2020 and the further delay or cancellation of film releases, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $151.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were recorded as of September 30, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. Due to the further delay or cancellation of film releases and the further suspension of operations in the International markets, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of December 31, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and the enterprise fair value of the International Theatre reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, goodwill impairment charge of $405.3 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020 for the Company’s International Theatres reporting unit. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and discount rates to be used in determining fair value, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Given the nature of the Company’s business and its recent history, future impairments are possible based upon business conditions, movie release dates, and attendance levels. As of September 30, 2019 and based on recent sustained declines in the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2019. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 9.9 % and 11.8 %, respectively. Accordingly, there was no goodwill impairment recorded as of September 30, 2019. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of December 31, 2019. Given the further decline in the Company’s stock price during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its two reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts as of December 31, 2019. The Company compared its projected financial information and assumptions utilized in the quantitative analysis as of September 30, 2019 to the fourth quarter results noting operating performance is consistent with the projections and there have been no other changes which would impact management’s conclusion that the fair values of its reporting units exceed their carrying values. The Company also observed that its estimated fair value of its corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations remained relatively consistent from September 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019, which represents approximately 80 % of the Company’s market enterprise value. The Company observed higher enterprise value control premiums for a recent acquisition agreement in its industry than those utilized for the market approach. In considering the totality of the aforementioned factors together with the excess of fair value over carrying value calculated in both its reporting units in the previous impairment test, the Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its two reporting units have been reduced below their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company concluded that an interim quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2019 was not required. Other Long-term Assets. Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 — Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable. Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $1.8 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years , with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years . The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recorded at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years , which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of food and beverage equipment. Sale Leaseback Transactions. Prior to adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the Company deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions and amortized the gains over the remaining lease term. Losses on sale leaseback transactions were recorded at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs, of $50.1 million and the deferred gain on the sale was approximately $27.3 million. Upon adoption ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the unamortized deferred gains related to sales leaseback transactions of $102.4 million were reclassified as a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. Impairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of theatre assets may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value, with the difference recorded as an impairment charge. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets that were impaired: ​

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of long-lived assets of $152.5 million on 101 theatres in the U.S. markets with 1,139 screens (in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming) and $25.4 million on 37 theatres in the International markets with 340 screens (in Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and UK), which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets. For indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Company recorded impairment charges related to the Odeon trade name of $12.5 million and Nordic trade names of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses in the International markets related to equity method investments of $8.6 million in equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $15.9 million within investment expense (income), related to equity interest investments without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method in the U.S. markets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $76.6 million on 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens and an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $7.7 million on 14 theatres with 148 screens in the International markets, which was related to property held and used, operating lease right-of-use assets, and a U.S. property held and not used in other long-term assets. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million within investment expense (income), related to an equity interest investment without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method.

Foreign Currency Translation. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings (loss), except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and also the Company’s £ 4.0 million, 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”). If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation or transaction balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Employee Benefit Plans. The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., and a defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that is not frozen. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan and a defined contribution plan. The following table sets forth the plans’ benefit obligations and plan assets and the accrued liability for benefit costs included in the consolidated balance sheets: ​

​ The offset to the pension liability is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. For further information, see Note 14—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for pension amounts and activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, net periodic benefit costs were $1.8 million, $1.7 million, and $1.1 million, respectively. The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is recorded in general and administrative other and the non-operating component is recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table provides the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years, and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter: ​

​ The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: U.S. equity securities of 43 %, fixed including U.S. treasury securities and bond market funds of 27 %, international equity securities of 23 %, and private real estate of 7 %. The international pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation. Investments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2020, for the U.S. investment portfolio, 95 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and 5 % of the investment included pooled separate accounts valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2020, for the International investment portfolio 2 % consisting of cash and equivalents was valued using quoted market prices from actively traded markets (Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), 37 % included pooled separate accounts and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), and 61 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Under the defined contribution plan, the Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, except during the 2020 furlough period, the Company matched 100 % of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3 % and 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of the employee’s eligible compensation. Income and Operating Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance. The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $32.7 million and $29.4 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $32.8 million, $32.6 million, and $25.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income): ​

​ Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance impacts how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and also contingent lease guarantees, where the Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. The Company recorded the cumulative effect upon adoption of the new standard related to credit losses for contingent lease guarantees of $16.9 million. See Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies for further information regarding contingent lease guarantees. The adoption impact on the Company’s allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables was immaterial as of January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. The cumulative effect of adoption was recorded to accumulated deficit under the modified retrospective adoption method. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy but are required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant observable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASU 2018-13 were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 12—Fair Value Measurements for the required disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation, setup, and other upfront costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. ASU 2018-15 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 prospectively and the adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is intended to improve consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis for goodwill. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and the applicable adoption method to be utilized. ​ NOTE 2—REVENUE RECOGNITION ​ Disaggregation of Revenue.

As the Company reopened theatres during the three months ended September 30, 2020, A-list members had the option to reactivate their subscription, which restarted the monthly charge for the program. The Company resumed the recognition of deferred revenues related to certain loyalty programs, gift cards and exchange tickets as operations resumed.

​ Gift cards and exchange tickets. The total amount of non-redeemed gift cards and exchange tickets included in deferred revenues and income as of December 31, 2020 was $319.7 million. This will be recognized as revenues as the gift cards and exchange tickets are redeemed or as the non-redeemed gift card and exchange ticket revenues are recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months . Loyalty programs. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of deferred revenue allocated to the loyalty programs included in deferred revenues and income was $67.0 million. The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months . The AMC Stubs Premiere TM annual membership fee is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. NOTE 3—LEASES The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably certain at the lease commencement and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Equipment leases primarily consist of digital projectors and food and beverage equipment. The following is the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019:

The Company received, or is in process of negotiating, rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided, or will aid, in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19. These concessions primarily consist of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. In instances where there were no substantive changes to the lease terms, i.e., modifications that resulted in total payments of the modified lease being substantially the same or less than the total payments of the existing lease, the Company elected the relief as provided by the FASB staff related to the accounting for certain lease concessions. The Company elected not to account for these concessions as a lease modification, and therefore the Company has remeasured the related lease liability and right of use asset but did not reassess the lease classification or change the discount rate to the current rate in effect upon the remeasurement. The deferred payment amounts have been recorded in the Company’s lease liabilities to reflect the change in the timing of payments. The deferred payment amounts included in current maturities of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Those leases that did not meet the criteria for treatment under the FASB relief were evaluated as lease modifications. The deferred payment amounts included in accounts payable for contractual rent amounts due and not paid are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accounts payable. In addition, the Company included deferred lease payments in operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of lease remeasurements. A summary of deferred payment amounts related to rent obligations for which payments have been deferred to 2021 and future years are provided below: ​

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had signed additional operating lease agreements for 6 theatres that have not yet commenced of approximately $155.2 million, which are expected to commence between 2021 and 2024, and carry lease terms of approximately 5 to 20 years . The timing of lease commencement is dependent on the landlord providing the Company with control and access to the related facility. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 4— PROPERTY ​ A summary of property is as follows: ​

============================================================

​ Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows: ​

​ ​ ​ ​ Buildings and improvements 1 to 40 years Leasehold improvements ​ 1 to 20 years ​ Furniture, fixtures and equipment ​ 1 to 15 years ​

​ Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $453.2 million, $413.6 million, and $498.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. ​ NOTE 5—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ​ The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by reporting unit: ​

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS ​ Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50 % voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2020, include interests in DCIP of 29.0 %, DCDC of 14.6 %, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0 %, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, 18.3 %, DCM of 50.0 %, and SCC of 10.0 %. The Company also has partnership interests in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50.0 % interest in 54 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. NCM Transactions Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2 % or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. In March 2018, the NCM Common Unit Adjustment ("CUA") resulted in a negative adjustment of 915,150 common units for the Company. The Company elected to return the units and recorded the surrendered common units as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $5.2 million, based upon a price per share of NCM, Inc. of $5.64 on March 15, 2018. The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. In June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, it reduced the Company’s then ownership of common stock shares in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM to zero. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5 %. The Company recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In March 2019, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 197,118 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $1.4 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $7.24 on March 14, 2019. In March 2020, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 1,390,566 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $4.8 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $3.46 on March 12, 2020. The Company does not have significant influence over this entity and the investment is recorded at fair value each period. DCIP Transactions The Company received distributions from DCIP in in the fourth quarter of 2020 of digital projectors it had been leasing with an estimated fair value of $125.2 million, which the Company recorded as a reduction to its investment in DCIP. The distribution reduced the Company’s recorded investment below $0 and therefore the Company recorded equity in earnings of $5.1 million to increase its investment to $0 as the Company has not guaranteed any of the liabilities of DCIP. The Company will not record its share of any equity in earnings of DCIP until such time as the excess distribution amount recorded to earnings has been satisfied with prospective earnings from DCIP. AC JV Transactions On December 26, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned 32 % by each of the Founding Members and 4 % by NCM. In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5 % per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments were due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing. The Company paid the sixth and final annual installment related to the promissory note in December 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the “Digital ESAs”) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. SV Holdco. (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity. SV Holdco has elected to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 30, 2018, Screenvision entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision. The Company received distributions and merger consideration of $45.8 million on July 2, 2018 upon consummation of the Screenvision merger and retains a 18.2 % common membership interest. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in Screenvision to $0 and recorded equity in earnings for the excess distribution of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Summary Financial Information Investments in non-consolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2020, include interests in SV Holdco, DCM, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC, SCC, 54 theatres in Europe, three U.S. motion picture theatres, and other immaterial investments.

Entry into Material Definitive Agreements Mudrick Transaction. On December 10, 2020, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Mudrick Capital Management, LP (“Mudrick”), pursuant to which Mudrick committed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the payment of the Commitment Shares (as defined below) and consummation of the Second Lien Exchange (as defined below), to purchase $100 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 to be issued by the Company. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information regarding the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026. On December 14, 2020, Mudrick received a total of 21,978,022 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock; of which 8,241,758 shares (“Commitment Shares”) relates to consideration received for a commitment fee and 13,736,264 shares (“Exchange Shares”) as consideration received for the second lien exchange. Mudrick exchanged $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 that were held by Mudrick for the Exchange Shares (the “Second Lien Exchange”) and waived its claim to PIK interest of $4.5 million principal amount. The fair value of 21,978,022 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock was $70.1 million based on the market closing price of $3.19 per share on December 14, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Class A common shares issued were recorded by the Company in stockholders’ deficit with an offset in other long term assets as a discount of $26.3 million for the Commitment Shares and as consideration of $43.8 million for the Second Lien Exchange. The discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 of $93.6 million based on the fair value of the Exchange Shares of $43.8 million and the carrying value of the $104.5 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes exchanged of $137.4 million. The Company filed a shelf registration statement in December 2020, which was declared effective providing for the resale of the Exchange Shares. Odeon Term Loan Facility. On February 15, 2021, Odeon entered into a new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million Odeon Term Loan Facility. Approximately £ 89.7 million and € 12.8 million of the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility were used to repay in full Odeon’s obligations (including principal, interest, fees and cash collateralized letters of credit) under its existing revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information and minimum liquidity requirements. Senior Subordinated Debt Exchange Offers On July 31, 2020, the Company consummated its previously announced private offers to exchange (the “Exchange Offers”) any and all of its outstanding 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, 5.75 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025, 5.875 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 and 6.125 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 (together the “Existing Subordinated Notes”) for newly issued Second Lien Notes due 2026. The aggregate principal amounts of the Existing Subordinated Notes set forth in the table below were validly tendered and subsequently accepted. Such accepted Existing Subordinated Notes were retired and cancelled. ​

============================================================

​ The Exchange Offers reduced the principal amounts of the Company’s debt by approximately $555 million, which represented approximately 23.9 % of the principal amount of the Existing Subordinated Notes. The Company raised $300 million in additional cash from the issuance of the new First Lien Notes due 2026, prior to deducting $36 million related to discounts and deferred financing costs paid to the lenders. Additionally, certain holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes that agreed to backstop the rights offering for $200 million of the First Lien Notes due 2026 received five million Class A common shares, or 4.6 % of AMC’s outstanding shares as of July 31, 2020, worth $20.2 million at the market closing price on July 31, 2020. The closing of the Exchange Offers also allowed the Company to extend maturities on approximately $1.7 billion of debt to 2026, most of which was maturing in 2024 and 2025 previously. Interest due for 12 to 18 months after issuance on the Second Lien Notes due 2026 is expected to be paid all or in part on an in-kind basis, thereby generating a further near-term cash savings for the Company of between approximately $120 million and $180 million. The Company realized significant cancellation of debt income for tax purposes in connection with its debt restructuring. As a result of such CODI, a significant portion of its net operating losses will be eliminated as a result of tax attribute reductions, see Note 10 — Income Taxes for further information. In connection with the Exchange Offers, the Company also received consents from eligible holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes to amend the indentures governing the Existing Subordinated Notes to among other things, (i) release the existing subsidiary guarantees of the Existing Subordinated Notes, (ii) eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain affirmative covenants and certain events of default contained in the indentures governing the Existing Subordinated Notes, and (iii) make other conforming changes to internally conform to certain proposed amendments. The Company performed an assessment on a lender-by-lender basis to identify certain lenders that met the criteria for a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors (“ASC 470-60”) as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and the lenders granted a concession. The portion of the loans that did not meet the assessment of TDR under ASC 470-60 were treated as modifications. The Company accounted for the exchange of approximately $1,782.5 million principal amount of its Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $1,289.1 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as TDR. The Company accounted for the exchange of the remaining approximately $235.0 million principal amount of its Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $173.2 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as a modification of debt as the lenders did not grant a concession and the difference between the present value of the old and new cash flows was less than 10 %. The TDR and modification did not result in a gain recognition and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the Existing Subordinated Notes and recorded the new fees paid to third parties of approximately $39.3 million in other expense, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Second Lien Notes due 2026. In connection with the Second Lien Exchange on December 14, 2020, Mudrick exchanged $104.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Second Lien Notes due 2026 held by Mudrick for 13,736,264 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, see “Entry into Material Definitive Agreements — Mudrick Transaction” above for further information. In connection with the Exchange Offers on July 31, 2020, the Company issued $1,462.3 million aggregate principal amount of the new Second Lien Notes due 2026 in exchange for the Existing Subordinated Notes. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company has reflected a premium of $535.1 million on the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as the difference between the principal balance of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 and the $1,997.4 million carrying value of the Existing Subordinated Notes exchanged. The premium will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. In connection with the Exchange Offers and the First Lien Notes due 2026, the Company issued five million shares of Class A common stock to certain holders of subordinated notes as consideration for their commitment to backstop the issuance of $200 million of the First Lien Notes due 2026. Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Agreement dated July 10, 2020, certain of the actual or beneficial holders of Existing Subordinated Notes agreed to purchase 100 % of the First Lien Notes due 2026 that were not subscribed for in connection with the $200 million rights offering to holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes participating in the Exchange Offers. Those providing a backstop commitment pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Agreement received their pro-rata share of five million shares of the Class A common stock, or 4.6 % of AMC’s outstanding shares as of July 31, 2020, worth $20.2 million at the market closing price on July 31, 2020. The equity issuance was recorded by the Company in stockholders’ deficit with an offset in corporate borrowings as a discount. The discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. As part of the registration rights agreement related to the issuance of the Class A common stock, the Company filed a shelf registration statement in August 2020 providing for the resale of the shares of Class A common stock issued as consideration for the backstop commitment described above. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 bear cash interest at a rate of 10 % per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, beginning on December 15, 2020. Subject to the limitation in the next succeeding sentence, interest for the first three interest periods after the issue date may, at the Company’s option, be paid in PIK interest at a rate of 12 % per annum. For the first interest period ending December 15, 2020, the Company elected to pay in PIK interest. The Company’s ability to pay PIK interest with respect to the third interest period after the issue date is subject to certain liquidity thresholds. For all interest periods after the first three interest periods, interest will be payable solely in cash at a rate of 10 % per annum. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 are redeemable at the Company’s option prior to June 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of their aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest, plus an applicable make-whole premium. On or after June 15, 2023, the Second Lien Notes due 2026 will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) 106.0 % for the twelve-month period beginning on June 15, 2023; (ii) 103.0 % for the twelve-month period beginning on June 15, 2024 and (iii) 100.0 % at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Company or its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to apply the net proceeds to redeem the new Second Lien Notes due 2026 at a price equal to 100 % of the issue price of the new Second Lien Notes due 2026, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture governing the Second Lien Notes due 2026), the Company must offer to purchase the Second Lien Notes due 2026 at a purchase price equal to 101 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and will mature on June 15, 2026. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that currently guarantee its obligations under the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 are secured on a second-priority basis by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets owned by the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries that secure obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility (“Collateral”). The Second Lien Notes due 2026 are subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company that is secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. The indenture governing the Second Lien Notes due 2026 contains covenants that restrict the ability of the Company to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; or transfer certain assets; create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. The Second Lien Notes due 2026 Indenture also contains certain affirmative covenants and events of default. First Lien Notes due 2026. In connection with the Exchange Offers, certain holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes purchased 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2026 in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2026 issued to certain holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee and collateral agent. Separately, upon the closing of its private debt exchange, Silver Lake Alpine, L.P. and Silver Lake Alpine (Offshore Master), L.P., each affiliates of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (“Silver Lake”), purchased from the Company $100 million principal amount of First Lien Notes due 2026.

The terms of the 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2026 issued to the holders of the Existing Subordinated Notes and the 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2026 issued to Silver Lake are substantially identical. The $300 million principal amount of new funding is prior to deducting discounts of $30.0 million and deferred financing costs paid to lenders of $6.0 million related to the First Lien Notes due 2026. The discount and deferred financing costs will be amortized to interest expense over the term using the effective interest method. Silver Lake has sold the previously held $100 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2026 previously held.

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the indentures governing the First Lien Notes due 2026), the Company must offer to purchase the First Lien Notes due 2026 at a purchase price equal to 101 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The First Lien Notes due 2026 have not been registered under the Securities Act and will mature on April 24, 2026. The First Lien Notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that currently guarantee its obligations under the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facility. The First Lien Notes due 2026 are secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. The indentures governing the First Lien Notes due 2026 contain covenants that restrict the ability of the Company to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; or transfer certain assets; create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company.

The Company is party to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2015, that certain Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016, that certain Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 9, 2017, that certain Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2017, that certain Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of August 14, 2018, the Sixth Amendment (as defined below), the Seventh Amendment (as defined below), the Eighth Amendment (as defined below), the Ninth Amendment (as defined below) and the Tenth Amendment (as defined below)), with the issuing banks and lenders from time to time party thereto and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent (as successor to Citicorp North America, Inc., the “Administrative Agent”), pursuant to which the lenders have agreed to provide the Term Loan Facility (as defined below) and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions On March 8, 2021, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Ninth Amendment”) with the requisite revolving lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such revolving lenders agreed to extend the Initial Covenant Suspension Period for the financial covenant applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information. In addition, on March 8, 2021 the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Tenth Amendment”), pursuant to which the Company agreed not to consent to certain modifications to the Credit Agreement described in the Tenth Amendment without the consent of the majority of the revolving lenders party to the Tenth Amendment. On July 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Eighth Amendment”) with Citicorp North America, Inc., as the administrative agent, pursuant to which certain restrictive provisions, including modifications to the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens, investments, asset sales and restricted payments, were added to the Credit Agreement to ensure that the terms and conditions of the First Lien Notes due 2026, the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the Second Lien Notes due 2026 (subject to certain exceptions) are not materially more favorable (when taken as a whole) to the noteholders than the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (when taken as a whole) are to the lenders thereunder. The Company accounted for this transaction as a modification of debt. On April 23, 2020, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Seventh Amendment”) with the requisite revolving lenders party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to suspend the financial covenant applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility for the period from and after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment to and including the earlier of (a) March 31, 2021 and (b) the day immediately preceding the last day of the Test Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during which the Company has delivered a Financial Covenant Election (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the Administrative Agent (such period, the “Initial Covenant Suspension Period”). During the Initial Covenant Suspension Period, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its restricted subsidiaries to, make certain restricted payments, and such conditions were further amended by the Ninth Amendment. As an ongoing condition to the suspension of the financial covenant, the Company agreed to a minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Seventh Amendment) test, which was amended by the Ninth Amendment. In addition, the Seventh Amendment provides for certain changes to the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens and restricted payments that are intended to match corresponding restrictions under the 10.5 % first lien notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Notes due 2025”) and to ensure that the terms and conditions of the First Lien Notes due 2025 (subject to certain exceptions) are not materially more favorable (when taken as a whole) to the noteholders than the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (when taken as a whole) are to the lenders thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the Seventh Amendment, these more restrictive terms will be operative until the repayment, satisfaction, defeasance or other discharge of the obligations under the First Lien Notes due 2025 or an effective amendment of, other consent or waiver with respect to, or covenant defeasance pursuant to the Indenture as result of which the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens and restricted payments thereunder are of no further force or effect. Certain Provisions of the Seventh Amendment are amended by the Ninth Amendment. On April 22, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) with each lender party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, the lenders agreed to provide senior secured financing of $2,225.0 million in aggregate, consisting of (1) $2,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B loans maturing April 22, 2026 (the “Term Loan Facility” and the loans thereunder, the “Term Loans”) and (2) a $225.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which is also available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice) maturing April 22, 2024 (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to repay all of the Company’s existing term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,338.5 million and to fund the redemptions of the 5.875 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 and the 6.0 % Senior Secured Notes due 2023.

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal payments on the Term Loan Facility. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, except for customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate announced by the Administrative Agent from time to time and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) an applicable margin plus LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at the Company’s option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate announced by the Administrative Agent from time to time and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable margins for LIBOR borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were 3.00 % and 2.50 % , respectively. The Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions will also be subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes a financial covenant that requires, in certain circumstances, compliance with a certain secured leverage ratio. Convertible Notes due 2026. Concurrently with the Exchange Offers, to obtain the consent of the holders of the 2.95 % Convertible Notes due 2024 (the “Convertible Notes due 2024”) to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Offers, the Company restructured $600 million of Convertible Notes due 2024 issued in 2018 to Silver Lake and others pursuant to which the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 was extended to May 1, 2026 (the “Convertible Notes due 2026”) (the “Convertible Notes” means the Convertible Notes due 2024 before July 31, 2020 and the Convertible Notes due 2026 after July 31, 2020), a first-priority lien on the Collateral was granted to secure indebtedness thereunder and certain covenants were modified. The Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an amended and restated indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company accounted for this transaction as a modification of debt as the lenders did not grant a concession and the difference between the present value of the old and new cash flows was less than 10 %. The modification did not result in the recognition of any gain or loss and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the Convertible Notes due 2024. Third party costs related to the transaction were expensed as incurred and amounts paid to lenders were capitalized and amortized through maturity of the debt. The carrying value of the Convertible Notes is as follows: ​

​ On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95 % Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 to Silver Lake and others. The Convertible Notes due 2024 would have matured on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. On April 24, 2020, the Company entered into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the Convertible Notes due 2024 indenture, dated as of September 14, 2018. The Supplemental Indenture amended the debt covenant under the Convertible Notes due 2024 Indenture to permit the Company to issue the First Lien Notes due 2025, among other changes. On July 31, 2020, concurrently with the Exchange Offers to obtain the consent of the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Offers, the Company restructured the $600 million of Convertible Notes due 2024 issued in 2018 to Silver Lake and others pursuant to which the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 were extended to May 1, 2026 (the reset of the conversion price as discussed below was not extended) and a first-priority lien on the Collateral was granted to secure indebtedness thereunder. The Convertible Notes due 2026 are convertible at the option of the holders thereof on the same terms as the Convertible Notes due 2024. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2026 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2026 at 2.95 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on September 15, 2020. On September 14, 2018, the Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98 % over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The Company also recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The Company recorded interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $31.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $32.6 million and for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability was remeasured at fair value each reporting period, a Level 3 fair value estimate, until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as other expense or income. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the derivative liability as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the conversion feature is indexed to the Company’s equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded in other expense (income) of $89.4 million, $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million, respectively, related to the derivative liability fair value adjustments for embedded conversion feature in the Convertible Notes due 2024. The if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2026 is less than the principal balance by approximately $505.8 million as of December 31, 2020 based on the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock of $2.12 per share. In addition, as a result of the adjustment to the conversion price, any future conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 will result in 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda being subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement (the “Stock Repurchase Agreement”) between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which was a Level 3 estimate of fair value. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature was not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2026 host and it was bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period until the conversion feature reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the derivative asset as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the number of shares that will be cancelled on conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 are known. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $19.6 million, $17.7 million, and $(45.0) million, respectively, related to the derivative asset fair value adjustment for contingent call option related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation agreement. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until September 14, 2020 and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2026 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes due 2026) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company recorded an immaterial non-cash correction of $26.2 million recorded in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. The adjustment related to the Company correcting the valuation methodology applied to the derivative asset related to the cancellation agreement entered into on September 14, 2018, a Level 3 estimate of fair value for a complex instrument developed in consultation with a third party specialist. Upon conversion by a holder of the Convertible Notes due 2026, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2026 (which represented an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, because the then-applicable conversion price was greater than 120 % of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the 10 days prior to the second anniversary of issuance on September 14, 2020 (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2026 was subject to a reset provision that adjusted the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision was subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. The volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on September 14, 2020 was $6.55 and, as a result, the conversion price reset provision was triggered. Effective as of September 14, 2020, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2026 was adjusted to $13.51 , which represents the conversion price that would result in 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital being issued upon conversion in full of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The conversion price reset provision was only applicable at September 14, 2020 and any future adjustments to the conversion price will be due to customary anti-dilution adjustments as set forth in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes due 2026. The holders of the Convertible Notes due 2026 may elect to convert the Convertible Notes due 2026 at any time and from time to time until September 15, 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2026 would be convertible into 44,422,860 , compared to 31,662,240 shares of Class A common stock before giving effect to the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020. See Note 17 — -Subsequent Events regarding the election to convert all $600.0 million of the Convertible Notes due 2026 into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“Odeon Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders made available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £ 100.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowed $120.8 million (the full availability net of standby letters of credit) under its £ 100.0 million Odeon Revolver ($136.3 million based on the foreign currency translation rate of 1.3628 on December 31, 2020). At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Odeon Revolver. The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility was 2.5 % plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee was 0.5 % of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral. On April 24, 2020, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited entered into an amendment to the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility with Lloyds Bank PLC as agent (the “Odeon Amendment”), pursuant to the requisite lenders thereunder granted a waiver of the maintenance covenant thereunder for the period from and after the effective date of the Odeon Amendment to and including the earlier of (a) March 31, 2021 and (b) the day immediately preceding the last day of the Relevant Period (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) during which Odeon Cinemas Group Limited has delivered a Financial Covenant Election (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) to the agent (the “Odeon Covenant Suspension Period”). During the Odeon Covenant Suspension Period, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, make certain restricted payments including payment on shareholder loans, provided that cash payments of interest with respect to shareholder loans will be permitted. Additionally, lenders granted a waiver such that certain events or circumstances resulting from COVID-19 virus occurring prior to the Odeon Amendment and continuing will be deemed not to constitute an event of default under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 17 — -Subsequent Events for information regarding the new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million Odeon Term Loan Facility entered into on February 15, 2021, the net proceeds used to repay its existing revolving credit facility, and the minimum liquidity requirements. First Lien Notes due 2025 On April 24, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2025, in a private offering, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 24, 2020 (the “First Lien Notes Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company used the net proceeds from the First Lien Notes due 2025 private offering for general corporate purposes, including further increasing the Company’s liquidity. The First Lien Notes due 2025 were issued with a discount of $10.0 million and bear interest at a rate of 10.5 % per annum, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The First Lien Notes due 2025 will mature on April 15, 2025. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $8.9 million related to the issuance of the First Lien Notes due 2025 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the term of the First Lien Notes due 2025. The First Lien Notes due 2025 are general senior secured obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior secured basis by all of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s other indebtedness, including the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facility. The First Lien Notes due 2025 are secured, on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facility, on a first-priority basis by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets owned by the Company and guarantors that secure obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility including pledges of capital stock of certain of the Company’s and the guarantor’s wholly-owned material subsidiaries (but limited to 65 % of the voting stock of any foreign subsidiary), subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens. The Company may redeem some or all of the First Lien Notes due 2025 at any time on or after April 15, 2022, at the redemption prices set forth in the First Lien Notes Indenture.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The First Lien Notes Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding First Lien Notes due 2025 to be due and payable immediately. Sterling Notes Due 2024 On November 8, 2016, the Company issued £ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "Sterling Notes due 2024") in a private offering.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, PSU awards of 730,167 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA, diluted earnings per share, and net profit performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, PSU awards of 653,669 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020.

On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the PSUs for the awards granted in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The modification included separating the three-year cumulative performance targets into three separate year performance targets applicable to each tranche year. Due to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, the Board of Directors waived attainment of the 2020 tranche year performance targets and established a vesting level for such PSUs at 90 %. In addition, the service conditions were modified, and vesting is now subject to the participant’s continued employment through the end of the three-year cumulative period. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as an exchange of the original award, that was not expected to vest, for a new award. The Company measured the fair value of the new award on the modification date, October 30, 2020, because the Company determined that achieving performance thresholds were probable for certain tranche awards. The Company recorded approximately $1.2 million, $(5.8) million, and $5.8 million of expense (credit) related to PSUs in general and administrative: other expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2019, a PSU market condition award of 300,000 was granted to an executive officer of the Company that would vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Class A common stock. This award was subsequently cancelled and replaced with the PSU market condition award granted on February 26, 2020.
============================================================

On February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020, special performance stock unit awards (“SPSUs”), totaling 3,570,000 units were granted to certain executive officers that will vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Class common stock. The SPSUs are eligible to vest in tranches contingent upon (i) the attainment of certain 20 trading day volume weighted average closing prices and (ii) fulfillment of the three-year service requirement from the date of grant. The vested SPSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting. Any unvested SPSUs remaining after 10 years will be forfeited. If service is terminated prior to the three year anniversary from the date of grant, unvested SPSUs shall be forfeited. The target prices and vesting tranches are set forth in the table below: ​

============================================================

============================================================

​ The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the SPSUs. This model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the SPSUs: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assumptions Expected stock price volatility ​ 45.0 % Expected dividend yield ​ 2.02 % and 2.44 % Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.33 % and 0.92 % Grant-date stock price ​ $5.93 and $4.92
============================================================

​ The expected stock price volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equivalent to the derived service period. The expected dividend yield is based on annual expected dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate was based on the treasury yield rates as of the date of grant for a period equivalent to the performance measurement period. The fair value of each SPSU is amortized over the requisite or derived service period, which is up to 6.4 years. The SPSUs granted on February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020 have a grant date fair value of approximately $12.2 million. On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the SPSUs for the awards. Each SPSU award agreement was amended as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● The stock price thresholds (ranging from $12 to $24) and service requirement for tranches 1 through 4 of the SPSUs were eliminated and such SPSUs vested on October 30, 2020;

As a result of the SPSU modification of market conditions, the incremental fair value amount assigned to the grant date fair value was approximately $7.3 million in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a total of $14.0 million related to SPSUs in general and administrative: other expense.

​ ​ NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 for domestic operations. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods on a federal, state and foreign jurisdiction basis. The Company conducts its evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. motion picture and broader economy, among others. During the first quarter of 2020, the severe impact of COVID-19 on operations in Germany and Spain caused the Company to conclude the realizability of deferred tax assets held in those jurisdictions does not meet the more likely than not standard. As such, a charge of $33.1 million and $40.1 million was recorded for Germany and Spain, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, several other international jurisdictions carried valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets at the beginning of 2020. Cancellation of Debt Income. On July 31, 2020, the Company consummated its previously announced private offers to exchange its Existing Subordinated Notes for newly issued Second Lien Notes due 2026.

For US tax purposes the Company is required to recognize CODI on the difference between the face value of debt exchanged and the fair market value of the new debt issued. The Company has determined that it should recognize an estimated $1.2 billion of CODI for tax purposes. IRS §108 provides relief from recognizing the CODI as current taxable income to the extent that the tax paying legal entity is insolvent as defined by the US Tax Code. The Company currently estimates that the level of its insolvency at July 31, 2020 exceeds the indicated amount of CODI resulting from the debt exchange. To the extent that the entity is insolvent, rather than recognize current taxable income, the entity may reduce its tax attributes including net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits, depreciable assets, investment in subsidiaries and other investments in the amount of the excluded CODI. For purposes of determining the current and deferred tax provision, and uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company estimated approximately $1.2 billion of its net operating losses have been eliminated as a result of tax attribute reduction. The actual effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was (1.3)%. The Company’s consolidated tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, foreign tax rate differences, federal and state tax credits, partially offset by state income taxes, permanent differences related to goodwill impairments, interest, compensation, and other discrete items. No tax impact was recorded on the $2,306.4 million goodwill impairment charge incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the portion impaired was permanently non-deductible. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $40.2 million and net deferred tax assets of $24.1 million, respectively. Cares Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property, as well as loans to certain qualifying businesses. The Company continues to examine the impacts that the CARES Act may have on its business. While the Company may take advantage of certain CARES Act’s cash deferral provisions, many of the provisions are not applicable to the Company. Additionally, as of the date of this filing, the Company has not participated in CARES Act loans. The income tax provision (benefit) reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components: ​

The Company has federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $686.5 million. Approximately $284.6 million will begin to expire in 2021, and will completely expire in 2036, and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $401.9 million can be used indefinitely. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $859.7 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $9.3 million, which will expire in various amounts between years 2022 and 2035. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $1,024.6 million. Approximately $735.3 million may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years . Approximately $289.3 million can be used indefinitely. A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: ​

​ The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense or penalties related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million of interest expense and $0.5 million of penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized no interest expense or penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $6.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $7.2 million of its unrecognized tax positions related to state taxes may be recognized by the end of 2021 as a result of settlements or the expiration of statute of limitations. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after December 31, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2020, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforward and other tax attributes became subject to the Section 382 ownership change limitation due to changes in our stock ownership on January 29, 2021. Accordingly, our ability to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be significantly limited. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information regarding change in stock ownership. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions. On January 22, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On September 23, 2019, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On March 2, 2020, plaintiffs moved to certify the purported class. The motion was fully briefed on September 21, 2020. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. On October 2, 2019, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Kenna v. Aron , et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-09148-AJN (the “Kenna Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on October 17, 2019. On April 20, 2020, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The Kenna Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 21D of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions and the Gantulga Action. The action remains stayed. On March 20, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Manuel v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02456-AJN (the “Manuel Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Manuel Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 21D, and 29(b) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, and the Kenna Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on May 18, 2020. On April 7, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Dinkevich v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02870-AJN (the “Dinkevich Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Dinkevich Action asserts the same claims as the Manuel Action based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, the Kenna Action, and the Manuel Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which was granted on June 25, 2020. On December 31, 2019, the Company received a stockholder litigation demand, requesting that the Board investigate the allegations in the Actions and pursue claims on the Company’s behalf based on those allegations. On May 5, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On July 15, 2020, the Company received a second stockholder litigation demand requesting substantially the same action as the stockholder demand it received on December 31, 2019. On September 23, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. , et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of common stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On January 8, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the court recommending that the court dismiss all of the claims asserted in the Lao Action, and moved to dismiss all of the claims in the Lao Action. The court has not yet ruled on the Special Litigation Committee’s motion to dismiss. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $15.0 million, in estimated credit losses related to contingent lease guarantees in other expense. The Company applied a probability weighted approach for the estimation of credit loss reserve for contingent lease guarantees expected to be funded over the lease term using the discounted cash flow method. The Company a contingent lease liability of $30.2 million recorded in other long term liabilities.

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations.

​ Valuation Techniques. There were a number of estimates and significant judgments that were made by management in performing these impairment evaluations. Such judgments and estimates include estimates of future revenues, cash flows, rent relief, cost savings, capital expenditures, and the cost of capital, among others. Attendance is expected to be below historical levels following the full reopening of our circuit and studios have shifted new film releases or moved them to the home video market, and movie release dates may continue to move in the future. The Company believes it used reasonable and appropriate business judgments. At December 31, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 11.0 % and 12.5 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 % for both of the reporting units. At September 30, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 12.0 % and 13.0 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 % for both of the reporting units. At March 31, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 11.5 % and 13.0 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 2.0 % for both of the reporting units. To estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names, we employed a derivation of the Income Approach known as the Royalty Savings Method. The Royalty Savings Method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. At December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, we applied royalty rates of 0.5 % for AMC and Odeon trade names and 1.0 % for Nordic to the related theatre revenues on an after-tax basis using effective tax rates. At December 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.0 % for AMC and 13.5 % for Odeon and Nordic, at September 30, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 13.0 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic, and at March 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.5 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate discount rates to be used in determining fair value, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. These estimates determine whether impairments have been incurred and quantify the amount of any related impairment charge. See Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information. Other Fair Value Measurement Disclosures. The following table summarizes the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value: ​

​ Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for Level 2 inputs. The Level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these convertible notes (now the Convertible Notes due 2026). The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. ​ ​ NOTE 13—OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting, which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. The Company has identified two reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia. On August 28, 2020, the Company divested of 49 % of its interest in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania operations. The Company completed the 100% divestiture of Latvia during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information on the Baltics theatre sale agreement. Operations located in Austria were sold during the first quarter of 2019. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees and other loyalty programs, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: ​

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

​ Vested RSUs, PSUs, and SPSUs have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, unvested RSUs of 1,131,333 , 1,377,992 , and 210,558 , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would be anti-dilutive. Unvested PSUs and SPSUs are subject to performance and market conditions, respectively, and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. Unvested PSUs of 649,209 , 477,630 and 364,269 at the minimum performance targets for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and unvested SPSUs of 578,328 at the minimum market condition for the year ended December 31, 2020, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or they would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has not adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to eliminate the interest expense of $31.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and the loss (gain) for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes of $89.4 million and $(23.5) million, respectively, in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. The Company has not included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 35.5 million and 31.7 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the effects would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adjusted net earnings to eliminate the interest expense and the (gain) for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2026 of $9.7 million and $(66.4) million, respectively, in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects were dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $13.51 per share, the Convertible Notes are convertible into 44,422,860 Class A common shares. ​ ​ NOTE 16—SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED) ​ ​

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Kansas City, Missouri February 27, 20 20 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

​ ​ See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ​ ​ AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 201 7 ​ NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. As of December 31, 2019, Wanda owned approximately 49.85 % of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 74.89 % of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, all of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to controlling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. Theatres and International Theatres. Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recognized at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100 % of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 12 % to 18 % of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Prior to January 1, 2018, income for non-redeemed exchange tickets were recognized 18 months after purchase when the redemption of these items was determined to be remote. At January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets to the proportional method, where it applies a non-redemption rate of 10 % to the current month sales, and the Company recognizes the total amount of income for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. Management believes the 24-month estimate is supported by its continued development of redemption history and that it is reflective of management’s current best estimate. The adoption of the proportional method of recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded online ticket fee revenues net of third-party commission or service fees. In accordance with ASC 606 guidance, the Company believes that it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. These changes did not have any impact on net income or cash flows from operations. Film Exhibition Costs. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded film payables of $166.5 million and $168.6 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Food and Beverage Costs. The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement. The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”) with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 — Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5 % to 8.5 %, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect transition adjustment of initially applying ASC 606 by increasing accumulated deficit on January 1, 2018 by approximately $52.9 million, including income tax effect of $0 , as a result of this change. These changes did not have any impact on the Company’s cash flows from operations. Customer Engagement Programs. AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program for the U.S. market which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs ® Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. Once an AMC Stubs Premiere TM or AMC Stubs Insider TM member accumulates 5,000 points they will earn a $5.00 virtual reward. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. Converted rewards not redeemed within nine months are forfeited and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. Prior to January 1, 2018, rewards for expired memberships were forfeited based upon specified periods of inactivity of the membership and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. As of January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing forfeited rewards from the remote method to the proportional method, where the Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. On June 20, 2018, the Company announced the launch of AMC Stubs ® A-List, a new tier of the AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests a unique subscription pricing structure for admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies for the monthly price of between $19.95 and $23.95 depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $42.6 million, $45.4 million, and $39.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents. All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability. The Company remeasures the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B common stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other expense (income) related to its derivative asset fair value of $17.7 million and $(45.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and other expense (income) related to its derivative liability fair value of $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations, Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity and Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for further discussions. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets were recorded at fair value for intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to theatre leases acquired under favorable terms, management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. Favorable leases that were previously classified as intangible assets were reclassified as an addition to the opening right-of-use (“ROU”) asset balances, as a result of adopting ASC 842, Leases, (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. As a result, there were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Investments. The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment income. Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 — Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2019, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.2 % interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50.0 % interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0 % interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6 % interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 10.0 % interest in Saudi Cinema Company LLC (“SCC”); a 50 % ownership interest in four U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50 % ownership interest in 55 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company had three reporting units, Domestic Theatres, Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company combined the Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres into a single reporting unit, International Theatres, to reflect how the international business is now managed. The Company tested goodwill for impairment both prior to and subsequent to the combining of these reporting units into the single reporting unit. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $4,789.1 million and $4,788.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in the common stock price and the resulting impact on market capitalization is one of several factors considered when making this evaluation. Based on recent sustained declines in the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2019. In performing the annual impairment test, the Company has an option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than the carrying values. Otherwise, the Company must perform a quantitative impairment test. The impairment test for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units, as compared to an equity value approach used previously. This change in estimate is preferable due to the impact of the change in the capital structure of the Domestic Theatres reporting unit late in the third quarter of 2018 as a result of the issuance of $600 million of the Company’s Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, the negative equity value carrying amount for the Domestic Theatres reporting unit, and the decline in the market capitalization since May 2019, which has increased the Company’s leverage ratio. See additional discussion in Note 6 — Corporate Borrowings. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 9.9 % and 11.8 %, respectively. Accordingly, there was no goodwill impairment recorded as of September 30, 2019. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of December 31, 2019. Given the further decline in the Company’s stock price during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its two reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts as of December 31, 2019. The Company compared its projected financial information and assumptions utilized in the quantitative analysis as of September 30, 2019 to the fourth quarter results noting operating performance is consistent with the projections and there have been no other changes which would impact management’s conclusion that the fair values of its reporting units exceed their carrying values. The Company also observed that its estimated fair value of its corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations remained relatively consistent from September 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019, which represents approximately 80 % of the Company’s market enterprise value. The Company observed higher enterprise value control premiums for a recent acquisition agreement in its industry than those utilized for the market approach. In considering the totality of the aforementioned factors together with the excess of fair value over carrying value calculated in both its reporting units in the previous impairment test, the Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its two reporting units have been reduced below their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company concluded that an interim quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2019 was not required. The Domestic Theatres reporting unit to which $3.1 billion of goodwill is allocated had a negative equity value carrying amount as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the Company assessed qualitative factors for both of its reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore no impairment charge was incurred. In addition, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of calendar 2018 and the third quarter and fourth quarter of calendar 2017. In all of these impairment tests, the Company reached a determination that there was no goodwill impairment. Other Long-term Assets. Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 — Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable. Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $40.9 million and $42.6 million, respectively. Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 or as of December 31, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years , with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years . The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years , which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of digital projectors and food and beverage equipment. As a result of adopting ASC 842, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes additional operating lease ROU assets and total operating lease liabilities of $4,796.0 million and $5,499.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The difference between the lease ROU assets and total lease liabilities upon initial measurement at January 1, 2019 was primarily due to the reclassification of: (i) deferred rent, landlord allowances, unfavorable lease balances, and theatre closure liabilities previously recorded in other long-term liabilities; (ii) current portions of theatre closure liabilities previously recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities; (iii) favorable lease balances previously recorded in intangible assets; and, (iv) prepaid rents recorded in other current assets within the consolidated balance sheets as an offset or addition to the opening lease ROU asset balances, as required by ASC 842. Sale Leaseback Transactions. Prior to adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the Company deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions and amortized the gains over the remaining lease term. Losses on sale leaseback transactions were recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs, of $50.1 million and the deferred gain on the sale was approximately $27.3 million. On September 14, 2017, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with seven theatres for proceeds net of closing costs of $128.4 million and the deferred gain on sale was approximately $78.2 million. On December 18, 2017, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds net of closing costs of $7.8 million. The loss on sale of $0.5 million was recognized immediately. Upon adoption ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the unamortized deferred gains related to these transactions of $102.4 million were reclassified as a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. Impairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of theatre assets may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value, with the difference recognized as an impairment charge. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets that were impaired: ​

============================================================

​ During calendar 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $84.3 million on 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens and 14 theatres with 148 screens in the International markets, which was related to property held and used, operating lease right-of-use assets, and a U.S. property held and not used in other long-term assets. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million within investment expense (income), related to an equity interest investment without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method. During calendar 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $13.8 million on 13 theatres in the U.S. markets with 150 screens and 15 theatres with 118 screens in the International markets which was related to property held and used. During calendar 2017, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $43.6 million on 12 theatres in the U.S. markets with 179 screens which was related to property held and used. Foreign Currency Translation. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and the Company’s £ 500.0 million, 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) are not included in net earnings. If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recognized as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Employee Benefit Plans. The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., and a defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that is not frozen. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan and a defined contribution plan. The following table sets forth the plans’ benefit obligations and plan assets and the accrued liability for benefit costs included in the consolidated balance sheets: ​

The Company expects to contribute $5.1 million and $0.0 million to the U.S. and International pension plans, respectively, during the calendar year 2020. The Company intends to make future cash contributions to the plans in an amount necessary to meet minimum funding requirements according to applicable benefit plan regulations. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:

​ The offset to the pension liability is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. For further information, see Note 14—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for pension amounts and activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, net periodic benefit costs were $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is recorded in general and administrative other and the non-operating component is recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: U.S. equity securities of 43 %, fixed including U.S. treasury securities and bond market funds of 27 %, international equity securities of 23 %, and private real estate of 7 %. The international pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation. Investments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which is determined using quoted market prices or estimated fair values. As of December 31, 2019, for the U.S. investment portfolio 7 % was valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information and 93 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. As of December 31, 2019, for the international investment portfolio 2 % was valued using quoted market prices from actively traded markets, 37 % included pooled separate accounts and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information, and 61 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Under the defined contribution plan, the Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, the Company matches 100 % of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3 % and 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of the employee’s eligible compensation. Income and Operating Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance. The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $29.4 million and $24.9 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $32.6 million, $25.1 million, and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income): ​

​ Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Leases. The Company adopted the guidance of ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The comparative information in the prior year has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 840, Leases, which was the accounting standard in effect for that period. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to recognize a lease ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 — Leases for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. ASC 606 was applied only to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The comparative information in 2017 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which was the accounting standard in effect during 2017. See Note 2 — Revenue Recognition for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers per the guidance in ASC 606. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. ASU 2018-02 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and early adoption of the amendments was permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a reclassification related to the stranded tax effects that increased accumulated other comprehensive income and increased accumulated deficit by $5.0 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2018. See Note 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for further information. Improving Presentation of Net Benefit Costs. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The guidance requires the service cost component of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from the services rendered by the pertinent employees while the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and reported outside a subtotal of operating income. The amendments in this guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018 and recorded a prior period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations to decrease general and administrative: other by $0.2 million, related to the other components of net benefit cost, with a corresponding increase to other expense (income) and decrease to other income of $0.2 million, respectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-18”). ASU 2016-18 requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018 and 2017 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. This guidance also requires a new disclosure to reconcile the cash balances within the consolidated statement of cash flows to the consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows: ​

​ Classification and measurement of financial instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 and recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to the unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities that are equity instruments with a corresponding decrease to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning of the year. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance will impact how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and evaluates its available-for-sale investments for impairment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). The guidance requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine whether to capitalize certain implementation costs or expense them as incurred. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2018-15 prospectively and is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ​ NOTE 2—REVENUE RECOGNITION ​ The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2018 for the adoption of ASC 606, are included in the following table: ​

The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months. The AMC Stubs Premiere TM annual membership fee is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. ​ The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 3—LEASES The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 or as of December 31, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.

​ (1) Included in the operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are assets and liabilities for leases related to previous build-to-suit failed sale leaseback transactions, that were derecognized and recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit upon adoption of ASC 842. These leases were classified and remeasured at January 1, 2019 as operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. (2) Corresponding with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company renamed previously classified capital lease assets and capital lease obligations under ASC 840 as finance lease right-of-use assets and finance lease liabilities, respectively. The Company recognized the finance lease right-of-use assets and finance lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 at the carrying amount of the capital lease asset and capital lease obligation as of December 31, 2018.

​ (1) Included in this column upon adoption of ASC 842 are liabilities for leases that were previously classified as build-to-suit failed sale leaseback transactions that were included in the capital and finance lease obligations columns in the prior year. (2) Included in this column upon adoption of ASC 842 are fixed executory costs that were previously excluded as part of the minimum lease payments. Fixed executory costs, which primarily consist of common area maintenance, insurance and taxes that meet the classification of fixed payments are included as part of the minimum lease payments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had signed additional operating lease agreements for 11 theatres that have not yet commenced of approximately $226.8 million, which are expected to commence between 2020 and 2023, and carry lease terms of approximately 5 to 25 years . The timing of lease commencement is dependent on the landlord providing the Company with control and access to the related facility. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company modified the terms of an existing operating lease to reduce the lease term. The Company received a $35.0 million incentive from the landlord to enter into the new lease agreement. The Company has recorded amortization of the lease incentive as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term which reduced rent expense by $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 4— PROPERTY ​ A summary of property is as follows: ​

============================================================

Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows: ​

​ ​ ​ ​ Buildings and improvements 5 to 45 years Leasehold improvements ​ 1 to 20 years ​ Furniture, fixtures and equipment ​ 1 to 11 years ​

​ Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $413.6 million, $498.2 million, and $495.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. ​ NOTE 5—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ​ Activity of goodwill is presented below: ​

​ ​ ​ NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS ​ Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50 % voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2019, include interests in DCIP of 29.0 %, DCDC of 14.6 %, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0 %, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, 18.2 %, DCM of 50.0 %, and SCC of 10.0 %. The Company also has partnership interests in four U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50.0 % interest in 55 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s recorded investments are greater than its proportional ownership of the underlying equity in its non-consolidated affiliates by approximately $36.6 million. NCM Transactions Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2 % or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. In March 2018, the NCM Common Unit Adjustment ("CUA") resulted in a negative adjustment of 915,150 common units for the Company. The Company elected to return the units and recorded the surrendered common units as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $5.2 million, based upon a price per share of NCM, Inc. of $5.64 on March 15, 2018. The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. In June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, it reduced the Company’s then ownership of common stock shares in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM to zero. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5 %. The Company recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In March 2019, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 197,118 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $1.4 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $7.24 on March 14, 2019. The Company does not have significant influence over this entity and the investment is recorded at fair value each period. SV Holdco. (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity. SV Holdco has elected to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 30, 2018, Screenvision entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision. The Company received distributions and merger consideration of $45.8 million on July 2, 2018 upon consummation of the Screenvision merger and retains a 18.2 % common membership interest. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in Screenvision to $0 and recorded equity in earnings for the excess distribution of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. DCIP Transactions The Company will make capital contributions to DCIP for projector and installation costs in excess of an agreed upon cap. The Company pays equipment rent monthly and records the equipment rental expense on a straight-line basis over 12 years, or until DCIP contributes the projectors back to the Company reducing the Company’s investment in DCIP. Open Road Films Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded additional equity in earnings (loss) in Open Road Releasing, LLC (“Open Road”) of $(8.0) million, related to certain advances to and on behalf of Open Road. On August 4, 2017, the Company and Regal Entertainment Group consummated a transaction for the sale of all the issued and outstanding ownership interests in Open Road for total proceeds of $28.8 million of which the Company received $14.0 million in net proceeds after transaction expenses for its 50 % investment including collection of amounts due from Open Road of $4.8 million and recognized a gain on sale of $17.2 million. AC JV Transactions On December 26, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned 32 % by each of the Founding Members and 4 % by NCM. In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5 % per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments are due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing. The Company paid the sixth and final annual installment related to the promissory note in December 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the “Digital ESAs”) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. Summary Financial Information Investments in non-consolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2019, include interests in SV Holdco, DCM, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC, SCC, 55 theatres in Europe, four U.S. motion picture theatres, and other immaterial investments.

​ Senior Secured Credit Facility The Senior Secured Credit Facility is with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for a Revolving Credit Facility, including a borrowing capacity which is available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice. Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On April 22, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) amending the Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013, by and among the Company, each lender party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc. (“Citi”), as administrative agent. After giving effect to the Sixth Amendment, the Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $2,225.0 million in aggregate, consisting of (1) $2,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B loans maturing April 22, 2026 (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (2) a $225.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit) maturing April 22, 2024 (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The loans were used to repay all of the Company’s existing term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,338.5 million and to fund the redemptions of the 5.875 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 and the 6.0 % Senior Secured Notes due 2023. The Company recorded a loss of $16.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to these transactions, comprised of $14.1 million of extinguishment losses and $2.5 million of third party costs related to the modification of the Term Loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Company’s current and future wholly-owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including:

============================================================

============================================================
● a pledge of 100 % of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the Company or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than 65 % of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and
============================================================


============================================================

============================================================
● a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

The Credit Facilities will require the Company to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:

============================================================

============================================================
● 50 % (which percentage will be reduced to 0 % if the Company attains a certain secured net leverage ratio) of the Company’s annual excess cash flow;
============================================================


============================================================

============================================================
● 100 % of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and condemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest 100 % of such proceeds, subject to certain qualifications; and
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● 100 % of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.
============================================================

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal on the Term Loan Facility. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, except (1) for customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans under the Credit Facilities and (2) during the six months following the Amendment Closing Date, with respect to certain voluntary prepayments or refinancings of the Term Loan Facility that reduce the effective yield of the Term Loan Facility, which will be subject to a 1.00 % prepayment premium. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate of Citi and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) an applicable margin plus LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at the Company’s option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 % per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate of Citi and (c) LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 % or (2) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. As of December 31, 2019, the applicable margins for LIBOR borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are 3.00 % and 2.50 % , respectively. The Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions will also be subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes a maintenance covenant that requires, in certain circumstances, compliance with a certain secured leverage ratio. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“Odeon Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders make available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £ 100.0 million ($131.2 million as of December 31, 2019). As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding and Odeon had £ 89.2 million ($117.0 million) available for borrowing, net of £ 10.8 million ($14.2 million) outstanding letters of credit (subject to limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness in the Company’s various debt instruments). The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility is 2.5 % plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee is 0.5 % of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral.

​ On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95 % Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 (the "Convertible Notes due 2024"). The Convertible Notes due 2024 mature on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2024 at 2.95 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on March 15, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to repurchase and retire 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock held by Wanda for $17.50 per share or approximately $421.0 million, associated legal fees of $2.6 million, and to pay a special dividend of $1.55 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, or approximately $160.5 million on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on September 25, 2018. The Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98 % over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also recorded debt issuance costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company recorded interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $32.6 million and for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million, respectively. The principal balance exceeded the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2024 by approximately $370.8 million as of December 31, 2019 based on the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock of $7.24 per share. Upon conversion by a holder thereof, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 (which represents an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2019, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 would be convertible into 31,662,269 shares of Class A common stock. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, in the event that the then-applicable conversion price is greater than 120 % of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten days prior to the second anniversary of issuance (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2024 is subject to a reset provision that would adjust the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision is subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. In addition, a trigger of the reset provision would result in up to 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda becoming subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The feature is contingent on the same reset of the conversion price which is part of the conversion feature. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature is not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 host and it is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $17.7 million and $(45.0) million, respectively. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than the special dividend referenced above and a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until the second anniversary of issuance and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2024 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the Convertible Notes due 2024) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024 for cash on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance at par if the price for the Company’s Class A common stock is equal to or greater than 150 % of the then applicable conversion price for 20 or more trading days out of a consecutive 30 day trading period (including the final three trading days), at which time the holders have the option to convert. The Company also has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024, between the second and third anniversary of issuance, if the reset provision described above is triggered at a redemption price in cash that would result in the noteholders realizing a 15 % internal rate of return from the date of issuance regardless of when any particular noteholder acquired its Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also bifurcated this redemption feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and considered it as a part of the overall fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded other income of $23.5 million and $66.4 million, respectively, related to the decrease in fair value of its derivative liability for the Convertible Notes due 2024. With certain exceptions, upon a change of control of the Company or if the Company’s Class A common stock is not listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market, the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 may require that the Company repurchase in cash all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and limit the ability of the Company to incur liens with respect to the Company’s senior subordinated notes or any debt incurred to refinance the Company’s senior subordinated notes. The Indenture also includes customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 under the Indenture. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by all the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. On September 14, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) providing for, among other things, registration rights with respect to the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2024. Subject to the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC not later than three months from the issuance date of the Convertible Notes in order to provide for resales of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company filed a registration statement with the SEC on December 14, 2018 to fulfill this requirement. Sterling Notes Due 2024 On November 8, 2016, the Company issued £ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "Sterling Notes due 2024") in a private offering. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $14.1 million related to the issuance of the Sterling Notes due 2024. The Sterling Notes due 2024 mature on November 15, 2024. The Company will pay interest on the Sterling Notes due 2024 at 6.375 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th, commencing on May 15, 2017. The Company may redeem some or all of the Sterling Notes due 2024 at any time on or after November 15, 2019 at 104.781 % of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100 % of the principal amount thereof on or after November 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On or prior to November 15, 2019, the Company may redeem the Sterling Notes due 2024 at par, including accrued and unpaid interest plus a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the Sterling Notes due 2024 private offering to pay the consideration for the Odeon acquisition and the related refinancing of Odeon debt assumed in the acquisition. The Sterling Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior subordinated unsecured basis by all of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. Following the closing of the Odeon acquisition on November 30, 2016 and the Carmike acquisition on December 21, 2016, neither Odeon or Carmike or any of its subsidiaries will guarantee the Sterling Notes due 2024. The indenture governing the Sterling Notes due 2024 contains covenants limiting other indebtedness, dividends, purchases or redemptions of stock, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and sales of assets. On November 8, 2016, in connection with the issuance of the Sterling Notes due 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement. Subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company is required to (1) file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) not later than 270 days from the issuance date with respect to the registered offer to exchange the notes for new notes of the Company having terms identical in all material respects to the notes and (2) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 within 365 days of the issuance date. On March 17, 2017, the Company issued £ 250.0 million additional aggregate principal amount of its Sterling Notes due 2024 at 106 % plus accrued interest from November 8, 2016 in a private offering. These additional Sterling Notes due 2024 were offered as additional notes under an indenture pursuant to which the Company had previously issued and has outstanding £ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 % Sterling Notes due 2024. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $12.7 million related to the issuance of the additional Sterling Notes due 2024. The Sterling Notes due 2024 mature on November 15, 2024. The Company will pay interest on the Sterling Notes due 2024 at 6.375 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th, commencing on May 15, 2017. Interest on the additional Sterling Notes will accrue from November 8, 2016. The Company may redeem some or all of the Sterling Notes due 2024 at any time on or after November 15, 2019, at 104.781 % of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100 % of the principal amount thereof on or after November 15, 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes due 2024 using net proceeds from certain equity offerings completed on or prior to November 15, 2019.

Financial Covenants Each indenture relating to the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Sterling Notes due 2024, the Notes due 2025, the Notes due 2026, and the Notes due 2027 allows the Company to incur specified permitted indebtedness (as defined therein) without restriction.

Under the indentures for the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Sterling Notes due 2024, the Notes due 2025, the Notes due 2026, and the Notes due 2027 at December 31, 2019, the Company could borrow approximately $215.0 million, net of $10.0 million in outstanding letters of credit available under its Revolving Credit Facility. If the Company cannot satisfy the coverage ratios of the indentures, generally it can borrow an additional amount under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Total reimbursements of other expenses from Wanda were $0.4 million, $0.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company’s majority shareholder, Wanda, owns Legendary Entertainment, a motion picture production company. The Company will occasionally play Legendary’s films in its theatres, as a result of transactions with independent film distributors. On September 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Silver Lake Alpine, L.P., an affiliate of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (“Silver Lake”), relating to the issuance to Silver Lake (or its designated affiliates) of $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations - Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 for more information. On September 14, 2018, the Company, Silver Lake and Wanda entered into a Right of First Refusal Agreement (the “ ROFR Agreement ”), which provides Silver Lake certain rights to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock that Wanda proposes to sell during a period of two years from the date of execution of the ROFR Agreement or, if earlier, until such time that Wanda and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 50.1 % of the total voting power of the Company’s voting stock. The right of first refusal applies to both registered and unregistered transfers of shares. Under the ROFR Agreement, in the event that Wanda and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 50.1 % of the total voting power of the Company’s voting stock, then the Company will have the same right of first refusal over sales of the Company’s common stock by Wanda as described above until the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date of execution of the ROFR Agreement. In such event, the Company may exercise such right to purchase shares from Wanda from time to time pursuant to the ROFR Agreement in its sole discretion, subject to approval by the disinterested directors of the Board. If the Company determines to exercise its right to purchase shares from Wanda pursuant to the ROFR Agreement, it will have the obligation under the Investment Agreement to offer to sell to Silver Lake a like number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the same per share price at which it purchased the Wanda shares. On September 14, 2018, the Company used the proceeds from the Convertible Notes due 2024, and pursuant to a stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda, repurchased 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock at a price of $17.50 per share or $421.0 million and associated legal fees of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2019, Wanda owns 49.85 % of AMC through its 51,769,784 shares of Class B common stock. With the three-to-one voting ratio between Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda retains voting control of AMC with 74.89 % of the voting power of the Company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 8, up to 5,666,000 shares of Class B common stock are subject to forfeiture for no consideration in connection with the reset provision contained in the Indenture. Temporary Equity ​ Certain members of management have the right to require Holdings to repurchase the Class A common stock held by them under certain limited circumstances pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement. Beginning on January 1, 2016 (or upon the termination of a management stockholders employment by the Company without cause, by the management stockholder for good reason, or due to the management stockholders death or disability) management stockholders had the right, in limited circumstances, to require Holdings to purchase shares that were not fully and freely tradeable at a price equal to the price per share paid by such management stockholder with appropriate adjustments for any subsequent events such as dividends, splits, or combinations. The shares of Class A common stock, subject to the stockholder agreement, were classified as temporary equity, apart from permanent equity, as a result of the contingent redemption feature contained in the stockholder agreement. The Company determined the amount reflected in temporary equity for the Class A common stock based on the price paid per share by the management stockholders and Wanda on August 30, 2012, the date Wanda acquired Holdings. ​ As of January 1, 2019, the remaining management employees who held 75,712 shares relinquished their put rights and the related share amount of $0.4 million was reclassified to additional paid in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one former employee and one current employee who held a total of 37,105 shares relinquished their put rights, therefore the related share amount of $0.4 million was reclassified to additional paid in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. Additional Public Offering ​ On February 13, 2017, the Company completed an additional public offering of 20,330,874 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.50 per share ($640.4 million), resulting in net proceeds of $616.8 million after underwriters commission and other professional fees. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of the Interim Bridge Loan of $350.0 million and general corporate purposes. Treasury Stock ​ On August 3, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a $100.0 million share repurchase program to repurchase its Class A common stock over a two -year period. Repurchases were made at management's discretion from time to time through open-market transactions including block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise until mid-August 2019 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. The extent to which AMC repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, depended upon a variety of factors, including liquidity, capital needs of the business, market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations, as determined by AMC’s management team. Repurchases were made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which permitted common stock to be repurchased when the Company’s management might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program did not obligate the Company to repurchase any minimum dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $8.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 3,195,856 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $47.5 million. The program expired on August 2, 2019. Stock-Based Compensation ​ 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ​ The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSU’s”), performance stock units (“PSU’s), stock awards, and cash performance awards. The maximum number of shares of Holdings’ common stock available for delivery pursuant to awards granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan is 9,474,000 shares. At December 31, 2019, the aggregate number of shares of Holdings’ common stock available for grant was 4,674,150 shares. ​ The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $4.4 million, $14.9 million, and $5.7 million within general and administrative: other during the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. 2019 Stock-Based Compensation Summary (in millions): ​

● Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2019, a PSU market condition award of 300,000 was granted to an executive officer of the Company that will vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s common stock (“2019 PSU executive”). Achievement of the target prices will be determined using the volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over a 20 trading-day period.

​ The vested PSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting. A dividend equivalent equal to the amount paid in respect of one share of Class A common stock underlying the PSUs began to accrue with respect to the PSUs on the date of grant. Such accrued dividend equivalents are paid to the holder upon vesting of the PSUs. The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the PSUs. This model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the PSUs: ​

============================================================

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, 2019 Expected stock price volatility ​ 45.0 % Expected dividend yield ​ 9.23 % Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.83 % Grant-date stock price ​ $8.67
============================================================

​ The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equivalent to the derived service period. The expected dividend yield is based on annual expected dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the treasury yield rates as of the date of grant for a period equivalent to the performance measurement period. The fair value of each PSU is amortized over the requisite or derived service period, which is up to 4.6 years. The PSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 have a grant date fair value of $1.4 million. Since the award was granted in December 2019, the Company recognized an immaterial amount of expense for these awards in general and administrative: other expense, during the year ended December 31, 2019.

​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 for domestic operations. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. On the basis of this evaluation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, a valuation allowance of $221.6 million was established domestically on the Company’s net deferred tax assets and considering indefinite-lived intangibles. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income is reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company maintained its domestic valuation allowance. An international valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets held in Spain was released in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting in a $41.5 million benefit to income tax expense. A significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was a cumulative income position over a three-year period. Statutory taxable earnings that permit the use of these deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, have stabilized to a profit position with significant improvement in 2019. Strategic initiatives have provided sufficient positive evidence that has resulted in the Company concluding the realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, limiting the amount of deductible interest expense, limiting executive compensation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 % to a flat 21 % rate, effective January 1, 2018. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance at December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $121.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is comprised of $88.6 million of deferred tax expense associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, as reflected in the rate reconciliation, and $210.4 million of deferred tax benefit associated with the partial release of the Company’s valuation allowance as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has assessed the deemed mandatory repatriation provisions of the Tax Reform Act, and is projecting no impact to current year domestic taxable income as it relates to undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company does not intend to distribute earnings in a taxable manner, and therefore intends to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the 100 percent dividends received deduction provided for in the Tax Reform Act, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes. As a result, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. While the Tax Reform Act provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current and prior year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current and prior year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The income tax provision (benefit) reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components: ​

​ The Company has federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $380.9 million. Approximately $290.9 million will begin to expire in 2020, and will completely expire in 2036, and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $90.0 million can be used indefinitely. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $487.2 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $6.2 million, which will expire in various amounts between years 2022 and 2028. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $380.4 million. Approximately $374.0 million may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years . Approximately $6.4 million can be used indefinitely. A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: ​

​ The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company determined it is not necessary to accrue additional interest and penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 related to prior years was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $12.2 million and $15.2 million, respectively. There are currently, unrecognized tax benefits which the Company anticipates will be resolved in the next 12 months; however, the Company is unable at this time to estimate what the impact on its unrecognized tax benefits will be. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after March 28, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2019, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions. On January 22, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On September 23, 2019, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. On October 2, 2019, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Kenna v. Aron , et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-09148 (the “Kenna Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Kenna Action asserts the same claims as the Gantulga Action based on substantially similar allegations. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on October 17, 2019. On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of common stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On October 25, 2019, the court granted a motion to stay the action for six months to allow the Special Litigation Committee to complete its investigation. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. Due to the variety of remedies available, the Company believes that if the current tenant defaulted on the leases it would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​ NOTE 12—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ​ Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ​

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. See Note 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the unrealized gain on equity securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: ​

There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and discount rates used in determining fair value, and therefore are classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy.

​ Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for level 2 inputs. The level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these Convertible Notes. The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. ​ The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. ​ NOTE 13—OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. The Company has identified two reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Denmark. Operations located in Austria were sold during the first quarter of 2019. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees and other loyalty programs, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: ​

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision, (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

(4) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operators in certain International markets. See below for a reconciliation of the Company’s equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where the Company holds a significant market share, the Company believes attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments. The Company also provides services to these theatre operators including information technology systems, certain on-screen advertising services and the Company’s gift card and package ticket program. As these investments relate only to the Company’s Nordic acquisition, the second quarter of 2017 represents the first time the Company has made this adjustment and does not impact prior historical presentations of Adjusted EBITDA.

============================================================

​ Vested RSUs and PSU’s have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs are subject to performance conditions and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, unvested PSUs of 477,630 and 364,269 , respectively, at the minimum performance target were not considered in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period and unvested RSU’s of 1,377,992 and 210,558 , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2017, unvested PSUs and Transition PSUs of 187,468 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 88,194 were not considered in the computation of diluted loss because they would anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes due 2024 that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has not adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 to eliminate the interest expense of $32.6 million and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $23.5 million, in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. The Company has not included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 31.7 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 30, 2019, as the effects would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adjusted net earnings to eliminate the interest expense and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $9.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively, in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects were dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $18.95 per share, the Convertible Notes due 2024 are convertible into 31,662,269 Class A common shares. ​ ​ NOTE 16—SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED) ​ ​

​ ​ NOTE 17—ACQUISITION ​ Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB ​ On March 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) for cash. The purchase price for Nordic was cash of SEK 5,756 million ($654.9 million), which includes payment of interest on the equity value and repayment of shareholder loans. As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed the indebtedness of Nordic of approximately SEK 1,269 million ($144.4 million) and indebtedness of approximately € 156 million ($169.5 million) as of March 28, 2017, which was refinanced subsequent to the acquisition. The Company also assumed approximately SEK 13.5 million ($1.6 million) and approximately € 1.0 million ($1.1 million) of interest rate swaps related to the indebtedness which were repaid following the acquisition. All amounts have been converted into US Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.11378 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0865 , which were the exchange rates on March 27, 2017. The acquisition was being treated as a purchase in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. The allocation of purchase price is based on management’s judgment after evaluating several factors, including a valuation assessment. The Company finalized the appraisals for both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

(5) Amounts recorded for other long-term liabilities include unfavorable leases of approximately $20.0 million with an amortization period of 9.3 years. (6) Includes equity method investments of $64.7 million. The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals, and market comparables. The purchase price paid by the Company in the acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill because it exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company paid a price in excess of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed because the acquisition of Nordic enhances its position as the largest movie exhibition company in Europe and broadens and diversifies its European platform. The Company also expects to realize synergy and cost savings related to the acquisition because of purchasing and procurement economies of scale. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company incurred acquisition-related and transition costs for Nordic of approximately $1.5 million and $10.1 million, which were included in general and administrative expense: merger, acquisition and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Nordic was acquired on March 28, 2017 and the Company immediately began integrating the operations. ​ ​ NOTE 18— SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ​ On February 26, 2020, Holdings’ Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share on Class A and Class B common stock, payable on March 23, 2020 to stockholders of record on March 9, 2020. The dividend decrease of $0.17 per share compared to the Company’s previous historical declarations of $0.20 per share reduces the total dividend payout for the quarter by approximately $18.0 million. Holdings’ Board of Directors approved a modification to the 2018 and 2019 PSU awards in February 2020, which eliminated the net profit performance target threshold. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020. ​ ​ NOTE 19—CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ The accompanying condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10, Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered.

​ See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ ​ Note 1 - Nature of Operations ​ Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, ("DCIP", and together with its consolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, the "Company") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 12, 2007 for the purpose of raising third-party capital to purchase and deploy digital cinema projection equipment ("Digital Systems") in theatres located throughout the United States and Canada. The Company is headquartered in New Jersey and has offices in Colorado and Minnesota. The Company is owned by its founding members American Multi-Cinema, Inc. ("AMC"), Cinemark Media, Inc. ("Cinemark") and Regal/DCIP Holdings, LLC ("Regal") (collectively, the "Founding Members"). On March 10, 2010, the Company completed an initial financing transaction for the deployment of Digital Systems utilizing its subsidiary entities Kasima, LLC ("Kasima"), Kasima Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") and Kasima Parent Holdings, LLC ("Parent") to execute its business plan. Kasima is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Parent is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DCIP. As part of the initial financing transaction, Parent entered into a note purchase agreement with a third-party investment fund. On March 31, 2011, the Company obtained the incremental financing necessary to complete its planned deployment of Digital Systems and on May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced all of its outstanding senior secured debt, extending the term of that debt and lowering its effective interest rate. On March 31, 2014, Parent repaid, in full, the outstanding notes under the note purchase agreement. On August 2, 2019, Holdings repaid, in full, the then-outstanding debt under its Credit Facility and retired that facility (see Note 7). Digital Systems are purchased by Kasima and leased to each Founding Member or one of its affiliates (each such entity, an "Exhibitor") pursuant to the terms of a Master Equipment Lease Agreement ("ELA"). Kasima facilitates the installation of the leased Digital Systems into each Exhibitor's theatres pursuant to the terms of an Installation Agreement. The Exhibitor is responsible for the ongoing maintenance and insurance of the Digital Systems. The Company has also entered into (and assigned to Kasima) long-term Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements ("DCDAs") with six major motion picture studios ("Major Studios") pursuant to which Kasima receives a virtual print fee ("VPF") each time the studio books a film or certain other content on the Digital Systems. These agreements will end on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) or when the Company reaches “cost recoupment”, each as defined in the DCDAs (see Note 2). Other content distributors have entered into DCDAs or shorter term agreements with the Company that provide for the payment of VPFs (or as more fully described and defined in Note 2, alternative content fees or “ACFs”) to Kasima for bookings of the distributor’s content on a Digital System. One such distributor, AC JV, LLC (“Fathom Events”), is related to DCIP through common ownership. On June 20, 2011, DCIP and Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership ("CDCP") entered into a long-term management services agreement (an "MSA" and with respect to CDCP, the "CDCP MSA") to manage a similar deployment of Digital Systems in Canada and to perform certain other specified services for CDCP related thereto (see Note 2). CDCP is a Canadian limited partnership formed by Cineplex Entertainment LP ("Cineplex") and Empire Theatres Ltd. ("Empire") to facilitate the purchase and deployment of Digital Systems to their theatres in Canada. On April 1, 2012, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Cinemark USA, Inc., a Texas corporation and an affiliate of Cinemark, to manage deployment of Digital Systems to theatres operated by its affiliates in Latin America (the "CNI MSA"). On September 1, 2014, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Fathom Events to provide it with management and software related services. The services we provide under this agreement have changed from time to time. The Company anticipates reaching cost recoupment as defined in the DCDAs in the fourth quarter of 2020. At that time the revenue from these contracts will end and it is anticipated the ELAs will be cancelled, ownership of the digital systems will be distributed to the Founding Members and the Company will enter a period of winding down its other activities in preparation for the cessation or transfer of the Company’s business. ​ ​ Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ​ Principles of consolidation ​ The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DCIP and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. ​ New accounting standards ​ In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (as modified “ASU 2016-02”), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities with corresponding “right-of-use” assets and was effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2018, subject to early adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. Upon adoption , th e Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability (See Note 9). ​ The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: ​ a. there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; b. a renewal option is exercised, or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; c. there is a change in the determination of whether fulfillment is dependent on a specified asset; or d. there is a substantial change to the asset. ​ Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). ​ Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ​ Use of estimates ​ The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to depreciation and recoverability of property and equipment, amortization, the valuation of derivative agreements and the reimbursement liability concerning equipment warranty and replacement costs under the ELAs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ​ Cash and cash equivalents ​ The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments and consists primarily of money market funds and other overnight investments. The Company maintains bank accounts with major banks, which from time to time may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. ​ Concentration of credit risk ​ For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had three customers that represented 36%, 33% and 34%, respectively, of operating revenues. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, three and four customers, each parties to the DCDAs, represented 50% and 55%, respectively, of net accounts receivable. None of the Company's other customers individually represented more than 10% of operating revenues or accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 or 2018, or for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. ​ The Company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable, which consists primarily of amounts owed by the Major Studios and other digital content distributors. The Company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit losses. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred bad debt expense of $674,000, $4,198,000 and zero, respectively. Bad debt expense in 2018 related primarily to two studio bankruptcies. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, management has determined that there is no requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts. ​ Concentration in foreign countries ​ The Company receives revenues from CDCP pursuant to the CDCP MSA with all payments being made in U.S. dollars. For 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenues earned from Canadian sources totaled $1,808,000, $1,812,000 and $1,799,000, respectively. Revenues earned by the Company under the CNI MSA for theatres located in Latin America was $548,000, $722,000 and $818,000, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Fair value and credit risk ​ All current assets and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. The Company's Credit Facility (see Note 7) was comprised of floating rate instruments and management believes fair value approximated carrying value. ​ Property and equipment, net ​ Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Computer equipment and software 3-5 years Leasehold improvements 5 years Digital cinema projection equipment 15 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years
============================================================

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it needed to reevaluate the useful life of its digital cinema projection equipment based on accelerated replacement of systems by the Exhibitors and other indicators. It was determined the estimate of useful life needed to be changed from 17.5 years to 15 years and as of December 31, 2019, a $13,537,000 adjustment was recorded. ​ Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Costs for general and administrative expenses, overhead, maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems, are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or other disposition of any property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposal is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. ​ Fair value measurements ​ The Company accounts for and reports the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company applies fair value accounting for financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. ​ The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"): ​ Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ​ Level 2 : Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ​ Level 3 : Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions. ​ The fair value of the Company's assets under its Interest Rate Swap (as defined below) was based upon observable market-based inputs that reflect the present values of the difference between estimated future fixed rate payments and future variable receipts and, therefore, is classified within Level 2. The Level 2 fair value of the Company's Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2018 was $472,000. Together with the payoff of the Credit Facility on August 2, 2019, the Interest Rate Swap was terminated. ​ Income taxes ​ The Company is a limited liability company and, as such, is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, as a partnership for tax purposes, the Company is not a taxable entity for federal income taxes and is not subject to significant state income taxes. However, the Company does pay certain state taxes based on revenue or net income that are reported as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income or loss of the Company as a limited liability company is reported to and included in the individual income tax returns of its members. Tax years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. ​ Impairment of long-lived assets ​ The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or conditions exist that indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for recoverability is based primarily on the Company's ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If the total of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the total carrying value of an asset, the asset is deemed not to be recoverable and possibly impaired. The Company then estimates the fair value of the asset to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the expected future discounted cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. ​ Revenue recognition ​ The Company follows the provisions of the FASB’s ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ​ Most of the Company's revenues are VPFs from Major Studios under the DCDAs. The Company earns VPF revenue when movies and certain other content distributed by Major Studios and other content distributors are booked and exhibited on screens utilizing the Company's Digital Systems. VPFs are earned and payable based on a fee schedule outlined in the DCDAs and other VPF agreements. The VPF revenue is recognized in the period in which it is earned, generally the first time the content is booked and exhibited in the theatre auditorium for which a Digital System has been installed. ​ The DCDAs with the Major Studios require the payment of VPFs for a period that ends on the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) for all Digital Systems scheduled to be deployed over a period of up to five years, or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. Cost recoupment occurs when revenues attributable to the Digital Systems exceed the costs associated with their purchase (including financing), deployment, administration and other allowed amounts, all as defined in the DCDAs. ​ In addition to VPF revenue, the Company also earns a fee each time certain digital content other than feature films (e.g., concerts, sporting events and opera performances) is booked and exhibited on a Digital System. The Company refers to fees derived on a per-exhibition basis from these alternative forms of digital content as ACFs. ACFs may be paid by the distributor of the alternative content pursuant to an agreement with the Company or by the Exhibitor showing the content pursuant to its ELA. ACF revenue is recognized in the period in which the alternative content is exhibited. ​ Lease revenues in respect of the Digital Systems and certain other rental and usage fees are earned by the Company in accordance with the terms of the ELAs. All amounts due to the Company under these agreements are recognized as revenue when earned and any unearned amounts are recorded as deferred revenue. The initial lease term for each piece of equipment deployed under the ELAs begins on the date the equipment is placed in service and continues for 12 years, with the first and last month incurring one-half of the monthly lease payment otherwise due. ​ The Company generates multiple revenue streams from the leased Digital Systems under the ELAs as follows: ​ Lease fees are payable by the Exhibitors monthly and prior to March 31, 2014 were comprised of a fixed base lease rate plus a "step-up" rate component for all equipment (regardless of lease commencement date) that was to occur on October 1, 2016. The Company recognized lease revenue from these fees on a straight-line method making an allowance for the step-up in rent that was to occur. On March 31, 2014, the ELAs were amended to remove the scheduled step-up lease payments. The accumulated effects of the amendments are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction in revenue over the remaining terms of the ELAs. ​ Peak period payments were due under the ELAs when the leased Digital Systems were taken out of service by an Exhibitor for one or more consecutive defined "peak periods" (generally a weekend) as a result of relocation, damage or a complex closing. Peak period payments, if any, were recognized, billed and paid monthly. The Founding Member’s obligation to pay these fees was terminated on October 1, 2019. ​ In accordance with the ELAs, the Exhibitors are required to acquire extended warranties with respect to the leased Digital Systems covering the period from the expiration of the initial included manufacturer's warranty through the date of repayment of the Credit Facility (the "Warranty End Date"), but in no event later than 12 years from the effective date of the ELAs. Following the Warranty End Date, the Exhibitors may choose to continue extended warranty coverage through the expiration of the DCDAs (the "DCDA End Date"). The DCDA End Date will occur on the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" (May 16, 2021) of the Digital Systems or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. The Company expects that the Exhibitors will maintain extended warranty coverage through the DCDA End Date. Pursuant to the ELAs, the Company is required to reimburse the Exhibitor for the costs of the extended warranties (and/or equipment replacement costs) subject to quarterly caps set forth in the ELAs. This contractual obligation by the Company to incur costs at a future date for the extended warranties or replacement costs when the leased equipment is purchased created a liability at the purchase date and a contra revenue adjustment in respect of revenues derived under the ELAs that is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. During the year ended December 31, 2019, based on performance to date and revised projections of future activities, management estimates that cost recoupment will be achieved in 2020. As a result, management now estimates that the warranty reimbursement obligation will end during 2020 rather than 2021. This change in estimate resulted in a $8,680,000 reduction in the overall warranty liability and related warranty asset. The impact of this change on the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent years is not material. ​ The Company also earns revenues in respect of the services DCIP provides under the MSAs. The revenues are earned ratably as the services are performed under the respective agreements. ​ Subsequent events ​ The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 18, 2020, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. ​ ​ Note 3 - Financing Transactions ​ On May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced its then outstanding senior secured debt, extending its term and lowering its effective interest rate. The transaction consisted of a $755,000,000 senior secured loan commitment (the Credit Facility described in Note 7) to Kasima from a group of commercial banks and institutional investors. This Credit Facility was paid off and retired on August 2, 2019. Note 4 - Consolidated Balance Sheet Components ​ Restricted cash ​ The Company had restricted cash of $0 and $3,702,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in the form of an interest reserve escrow account and excess cost escrow account for the funding of Digital Systems in excess of costs caps, both related to the Credit Facility (see Note 7). ​ Accounts receivable, net ​ Accounts receivable, net consists of the following ($in thousands): ​

​ Revenues earned under the ELAs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $18,989,000, $20,409,000 and $20,629,000, respectively. ​ ​ Note 7- Long-term Debt, net ​ Credit facilities ​ On May 17, 2013, DCIP, Holdings and Kasima entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC as Administrative Agent and a group of lenders which agreed to provide Kasima a $75 million revolving line of credit ("Revolver") and a $680 million term loan ("Term Loan B" and together with the Revolver, the "Credit Facility"). The Term Loan B was fully funded at the closing of the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Term Loan B were used to repay all amounts under the then outstanding credit facility and to repay fees, transaction costs and other expenses incurred in connection with such repayment and the establishment of the Credit Facility. All costs of Digital Systems exceeding established caps must be funded by capital contributions from the Founding Members. The Credit Facility was retired on August 2, 2019 and all outstanding debt was repaid. ​ Interest expense on long-term debt was $1,042,000, $5,327,000 and $10,602,000, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Derivatives ​ The Interest Rate Swap contracts were entered into for interest expense cost protection from rising variable interest rates and are associated with the Credit Facility which was paid off and retired on August 2, 2019. ​ Note 8 - Retirement Plan ​ The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for eligible employees under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's plan provides for eligible employees to contribute up to 80% of eligible compensation with a Company contribution of 4% of eligible wages. All employees are eligible to participate in the plan upon hire. The Company's contributions to the plan totaled $146,000, $139,000 and $140,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ​ Note 9 - Operating Leases ​ The Company has various operating lease agreements for its offices. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. At December 31, 2019, the remaining lease terms range from two to 25 months. The agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties in the contract. ​ The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 beginning January 1, 2019 and adopted the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Accordingly, the Company: ​

​ In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively determine the lease term and assess the impairment of its right-of-use assets. At the date of transition, the Company recognized an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset. The amount of lease liability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments as of January 1, 2019 discounted using the Company’s secured borrowing rate as of that date. ​ A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. ​ The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to operating leases:

​ The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rates of the operating leases were 23 months and 4.80%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. ​ Note 10 - Commitments ​ Employment agreements ​ The Company has employment agreements with two of its key executives setting forth key compensation terms (generally annual salary plus a defined bonus) and providing each executive with a severance benefit in the case the executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive resigns with good reason, each as defined. Tax matters The Company is from time to time audited by state and local taxing authorities and as of December 31, 2019, certain assessments are in negotiation with various taxing authorities. The Company believes the potential tax liabilities will be resolved for $4,335,000 and has accrued this amount as of December 31, 2019. ​ Note 11 - Related Party Transactions ​ At December 31, 2019, all of the Company's Digital Systems are leased to the Exhibitors under the ELAs.

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no liability for reimbursement of equipment purchases due to the Exhibitors. The $11,530,000 warranty reimbursement liability represents a liability to reimburse the Exhibitors for the extended equipment warranty and other replacement costs (as defined in the ELAs) as cash payments that began in 2011 and continues through the DCDA End Date (see Note 2). Warranty reimbursements earned for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $45,851,000, $41,717,000 and $32,680,000, respectively.

Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Kansas City, Missouri February 28, 2019 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”).

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 NOTE 1 – THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. On March 31, 2016, AMC Entertainment Inc. merged with and into Holdings, its direct parent company. In connection with the merger, Holdings assumed all of the obligations pursuant to the indentures to the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 (“Notes due 2022”), the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 (“Notes due 2025”) and the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as subsequently amended). As of December 31, 2018, Wanda owned approximately 50.01% of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 75.01% of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no noncontrolling (minority) interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, all of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to controlling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Revenues: The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recognized at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100% of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 12% to 18% of the current month sales, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Prior to January 1, 2018, income for non-redeemed exchange tickets were recognized 18 months after purchase when the redemption of these items was determined to be remote. At January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets to the proportional method, where it applies a non-redemption rate of 10% to the current month sales, and the Company recognizes the total amount of income for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. Management believes the 24-month estimate is supported by its continued development of redemption history and that it is reflective of management’s current best estimate. The adoption of the proportional method of recognizing income from non-redeemed exchange tickets did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded online ticket fee revenues net of third-party commission or service fees. In accordance with ASC 606 guidance, the Company believes that it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. These changes did not have any impact on net income or cash flows from operations. Film Exhibition Costs: Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded film payables of $168.6 million and $229.4 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Food and Beverage Costs: The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement: The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s ESA with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 – Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5% to 8.5%, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. The Company recognized a cumulative effect transition adjustment of initially applying ASC 606 by increasing accumulated deficit on January 1, 2018 by approximately $52.9 million, including income tax effect of $0, as a result of this change. These changes did not have any impact on the Company’s cash flows from operations. Customer Frequency Program: AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. Once an AMC Stubs Premiere TM or AMC Stubs Insider TM member accumulates 5,000 points they will earn a $5.00 virtual reward. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. Converted rewards not redeemed within nine months are forfeited and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. Prior to January 1, 2018, rewards for expired memberships were forfeited based upon specified periods of inactivity of the membership and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. As of January 1, 2018, the Company changed its method for recognizing forfeited rewards from the remote method to the proportional method, where the Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. On June 20, 2018, the Company announced the launch of AMC Stubs ® A-List, a new tier of our AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 to $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs: The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $45.4 million, $39.9 million, and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability: The Company remeasures the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B Common Stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other income related to increases in its derivative asset fair value of $45.0 million and other income related to decreases in its derivative liability fair value of $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings and Capital and Financing Lease Obligations, Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity and Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for further discussions. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets were recorded at fair value, in the case of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to theatre leases acquired under favorable terms, management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. There were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. Investments: The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment income. Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 – Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2018, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.4% interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50% interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0% interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29% interest in DCIP, a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6% interest in DCDC, a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 50% ownership interest in four U.S. motion picture theatres and one IMAX ® screen; and approximately 50% ownership interest in 58 theatres in Europe acquired in the Nordic acquisition. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company is not required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings; however, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill for impairment. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $4,788.7 million and $4,931.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. The Company’s goodwill is recorded in each of its three reporting units for its Domestic Theatres, Odeon Theatres, and Nordic Theatres. The Company performed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of calendar 2018 and the third quarter and fourth quarter of calendar 2017 and reached a determination that there was no goodwill or trademark and trade name impairment. According to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-20, the Company has an option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. As of October 1, 2018, the Company performed a step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test on the Odeon and Nordic reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore, no impairment charge was incurred. As of December 31, 2018, the Company assessed qualitative factors for all three reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore no impairment charge was incurred. During the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, and as of December 31, 2017, the Company assessed qualitative factors of all three reporting units and reached a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values, and therefore, no impairment charge was incurred. Other Long-term Assets : Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable: Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $42.6 million and $72.8 million, respectively. Leases: The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years, with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years. The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index not to exceed certain specified amounts and contingent rentals based on revenues. The Company records rent expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the initial base lease term commencing with the date the Company has “control and access” to the leased premises, which is generally a date prior to the “lease commencement date” in the lease agreement. Rent expense related to any “rent holiday” is recorded as operating expense, until construction of the leased premises is complete and the premises are ready for their intended use. Rent charges upon completion of the leased premises subsequent to the date the premises are ready for their intended use are expensed as a component of rent expense. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as deferred rent and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. The Company evaluates the classification of its leases following the guidance in ASC 840-10-25. Leases that qualify as capital leases are generally recorded at the present value of the future minimum rentals over the base term of the lease using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Capital lease assets are assigned an estimated useful life at the inception of the lease that generally corresponds with the base term of the lease. Occasionally, the Company or other theatre operators it has acquired are responsible for the construction of new leased theatres (build-to-suit lease arrangements) and for paying project costs that are in excess of an agreed upon amount to be reimbursed from the developer. ASC 840-40-05-5 requires the Company to be considered the owner (for accounting purposes) of these types of projects during the construction period and therefore it is required to account for these projects as sale and leaseback transactions. As a result, the Company has recorded financing lease obligations for failed sale leaseback transactions of $427.4 million and $499.6 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these types of projects as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company modified the terms of an existing operating lease to reduce the lease term. The Company received a $35.0 million incentive from the landlord to enter into the new lease agreement. The Company has recorded amortization of the lease incentive as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term which reduced rent expense by $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Sale and Leaseback Transactions: The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC 840-40. Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs of $50.1 million. The gain on the sale of approximately $27.3 million has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining lease term. On September 14, 2017, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with seven theatres for proceeds net of closing costs of $128.4 million. The gain on sale of approximately $78.2 million has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining lease term. On December 18, 2017, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds net of closing costs of $7.8 million. The loss on sale of $0.5 million was recognized immediately. Unamortized deferred gains related to these transactions were $98.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles, investments in non-consolidated equity method investees, and internal use software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company reviews internal management reports on a quarterly basis as well as monitors current and potential future competition in the markets where it operates for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate potential impairment of individual theatre assets. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The Company performs its impairment analysis quarterly. Under these analyses, if the sum of the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date for the fair value of Property, net. The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable existing renewal options will be exercised and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements. During calendar 2018, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $13.8 million on 13 theatres in the U.S. markets with 150 screens and 15 theatres with 118 screens in the international markets which was related to property, net. During calendar 2017, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $43.6 million on 12 theatres in the U.S. markets with 179 screens which was related to property, net. During calendar 2016, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million on two theatres in the U.S. markets with 22 screens, which was related to property, net. Foreign Currency Translation: Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and the Company’s £500.0 million, 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) are not included in net earnings. If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Income and Operating Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. The statement of operations effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance: The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $24.9 million and $28.1 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $25.1 million, of $22.1 million, and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income):

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. ASC 606 was applied only to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The comparative information in the prior year has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which was the accounting standard in effect for those periods. See Note 2 – Revenue Recognition for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers per the guidance in ASC 606. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. ASU 2018-02 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a reclassification related to the stranded tax effects that increased accumulated other comprehensive income and increased accumulated deficit by $5.0 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2018. See Note 17 – Accumulated other comprehensive income for further information. Modification Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (“ASU 2017-09”), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements and provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of the share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 on January 1, 2018 and will apply the guidance in ASU 2017-09 to any future changes to the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards should they occur. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Improving Presentation of Net Benefit Costs. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The guidance requires the service cost component of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from the services rendered by the pertinent employees while the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and reported outside a subtotal of operating income. The amendments in this guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018 and recorded a prior period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations to decrease general and administrative other by $0.2 million, related to the other components of net benefit cost, with a corresponding increase to other expense (income) and decrease to other income of $0.2 million, respectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-18”). ASU 2016-18 requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018 and the prior period has been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. This guidance also requires a new disclosure to reconcile the cash balances within the consolidated statement of cash flows to the consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows:

============================================================

============================================================

Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”). The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues. The update provides specific guidance on each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 and made an election to continue using the “nature of the distribution approach” to classify distributions received from equity method investments. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. Classification and measurement of financial instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 and recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.6 million, net of tax, related to the unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities that are equity instruments with a corresponding decrease to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning of the year. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (“ASC 842”) which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (“ROU”) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application, whereby comparative prior period financial information and disclosures will not be adjusted to reflect the new standard. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases, which permits an entity to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under ASU 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASC 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases. ASC 842 provides several optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company expects to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements but does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. The Company also expects to elect the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases for leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company expects that this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. While the Company is finalizing the effect of adoption, the Company expects the most significant changes relate to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet for theatres currently subject to operating leases adjusted for the balances of prepaid rent, favorable lease assets and unfavorable lease liabilities, and deferred rent; (2) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain sale leaseback transactions (those arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements for which construction is complete and the Company is leasing the constructed asset) that currently do not qualify for sale accounting and the recognition of new ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on its balance sheet; (3) the derecognition of deferred gains from the sale and leaseback transactions; and (4) providing new disclosures about the Company’s leasing activities. On January 1, 2019, the Company expects to recognize additional operating lease liabilities ranging from an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion, with corresponding ROU assets based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments using preliminary estimates of discount rates for the Company’s existing operating leases. The Company has not finalized the effects of these expected changes from the new standard . Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance will impact how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and evaluates its available-for-sale investments for impairment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-13 will have on its fair value measurement disclosures. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other–Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation, setup, and other upfront costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The total amount of non-redeemed gifts cards and exchange tickets included in deferred revenues and income as of December 31, 2018 was $337.4 million. This will be recognized as revenues as the gift cards and exchange tickets are redeemed or as the non-redeemed gift card and exchange ticket revenues are recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of deferred revenue allocated to the AMC Stubs ® loyalty programs included in deferred revenues and income was $47.7 million. The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months. The annual membership fee is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. NOTE 3 – ACQUISITIONS Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited. On November 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Odeon for approximately £510.4 million ($637.1 million) comprised of cash of approximately £384.8 million ($480.3 million) and 4,536,466 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock with a fair value of £125.6 million ($156.4 million) based on a closing share price of $34.55 per share on November 29, 2016. The amounts set forth above are based on a GBP/USD exchange rate of approximately 1.25 on November 30, 2016.

The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals, and market comparables. The purchase price paid by the Company in the acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill because it exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company paid a price in excess of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed because the acquisition of Nordic enhances its position as the largest movie exhibition company in Europe and broadens and diversifies its European platform. The Company also expects to realize synergy and cost savings related to the acquisition because of purchasing and procurement economies of scale. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company incurred acquisition-related and transition costs for Nordic of approximately $1.5 million and $10.1 million, which were included in general and administrative expense: merger, acquisition and transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Nordic was acquired on March 28, 2017 and the Company immediately began integrating the operations. The revenues for Nordic during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $374.1 million, and net earnings was $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Pro Forma Results of Operations (Unaudited) The following selected comparative unaudited actual results of operation information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the comparative unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 assumes that the Odeon, Carmike, and Nordic acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2016, and reflects the full results of operations for the years presented. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to indicate the results of operations which would actually have occurred had the combination been in effect on the dates indicated, or which may occur in the future. These amounts have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of Odeon, Carmike, and Nordic to reflect the fair value adjustments to property and equipment and financing obligations. The pro forma financial information presented includes the effects of adjustments related to preliminary values assigned to long-lived assets, including depreciation charges from acquired property and equipment, interest expense and incremental shares issued from financing the acquisitions and the related income tax effects and the elimination of Carmike and AMC historical revenues and expenses for theatres in markets that were divested as required by the Department of Justice. Merger, acquisition and transaction costs directly related to the acquisitions have not been removed.

============================================================

Property is recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of property resulting from acquisitions. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

============================================================

============================================================
Buildings and improvements 5 to 45 years Leasehold improvements 1 to 20 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 1 to 11 years
============================================================

Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $498.2 million, $495.2 million, and $239.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. On June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc.

The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2% or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. The Company has a mortgage note payable to NCM in the amount of $1.3 million in current maturities of corporate borrowings and capital and finance lease obligations.

============================================================

On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 (the "Convertible Notes due 2024"). The Convertible Notes due 2024 mature on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2024 at 2.95% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on March 15, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to repurchase and retire 24,057,143 shares of Class B common stock held by Wanda for $17.50 per share or approximately $421.0 million, associated legal fees of $2.6 million, and to pay a special dividend of $1.55 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, or approximately $160.5 million on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on September 25, 2018. The Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98% over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also recorded debt issuance costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company recorded interest expense for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this resulted in other income of $66.4 million. The principal balance exceeded the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2024 by approximately $211.2 million as of December 31, 2018 based on the closing price per share of our common stock of $12.28 per share. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are generally not convertible to equity in the first year after issuance. Upon conversion by a holder thereof, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 (which represents an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2018, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 would be convertible into 31,662,269 shares of Class A common stock. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, in the event that the then-applicable conversion price is greater than 120% of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten days prior to the second anniversary of issuance (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2024 is subject to a reset provision that would adjust the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision is subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30% of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. In addition, a trigger of the reset provision would result in up to 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda becoming subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The feature is contingent on the same reset of the conversion price which is part of the conversion feature. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature is not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 host and it is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this resulted in other income of $45.0 million. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than the special dividend referenced above and a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until the second anniversary of issuance and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2024 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture (the “Indenture”) governing the Convertible Notes due 2024) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024 for cash on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance at par if the price for the Company’s Class A common stock is equal to or greater than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for 20 or more trading days out of a consecutive 30 day trading period (including the final three trading days), at which time the holders have the option to convert. The Company also has the option to redeem the Convertible Notes due 2024, between the second and third anniversary of issuance, if the reset provision described above is triggered at a redemption price in cash that would result in the noteholders realizing a 15% IRR from the date of issuance regardless of when any particular noteholder acquired its Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company also bifurcated this redemption feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and considered it as a part of the overall fair value of the derivative liability. With certain exceptions, upon a change of control of the Company or if the Company’s Class A common stock is not listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market, the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 may require that the Company repurchase in cash all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and limit the ability of the Company to incur liens with respect to the Company’s senior subordinated notes or any debt incurred to refinance the Company’s senior subordinated notes. The Indenture also includes customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 under the Indenture. The Convertible Notes due 2024 are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by all the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness. On September 14, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) providing for, among other things, registration rights with respect to the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2024. Subject to the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC not later than three months from the issuance date of the Convertible Notes in order to provide for resales of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company filed a registration statement with the SEC on December 14, 2018 to fulfill this requirement. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders make available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £100.0 million ($126.8 million as of December 31, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, there were borrowings of £9.4 million ($11.9 million) outstanding and Odeon had £73.9 million ($93.7 million) available for borrowing, net £16.7 million ($21.2 million) letters of credit. The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the revolving credit facility is 2.5% plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee is 0.5% of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral. Bridge Loan Agreement On December 21, 2016, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Bridge Loan Agreement”). The Company borrowed $350.0 million of interim bridge loans (the “Interim Bridge Loans”) on December 21, 2016 under the Bridge Loan Agreement and recorded approximately $4.4 million in deferred financing costs. The proceeds of the Interim Bridge Loans were used to partially finance the acquisition of Carmike. On February 13, 2017, the Company repaid the aggregate principal amount of Interim Bridge Loans of $350.0 million with a portion of the proceeds from its public offering of shares of Holdings Class A common stock, as discussed in Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity. The Company recorded a loss of $0.4 million in other income, which included a write-off of deferred financing costs of $3.7 million, partially offset by a refund of fees of $3.3 million on the extinguishment of indebtedness related to the redemption of the interim bridge loan. Senior Secured Credit Facility The Senior Secured Credit Facility is with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for a Revolving Credit Facility, including a borrowing capacity which is available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice. Senior Secured Credit Facility. On April 30, 2013, the Company entered into a $925.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility pursuant to which the Company borrowed term loans and used the proceeds to fund the redemption of the former Senior Secured Credit Facility term loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was comprised of a $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matured on April 30, 2018 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), and a $775.0 million term loan, which matures on April 30, 2020 (the “Term Loan due 2020”). The Term Loan due 2020 required repayments of principal of 0.25% of the original principal amount, or $1.9 million, per quarter, with the remaining principal payable upon maturity. The term loan was issued at a 0.25% discount, which was amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The Company capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately $6.9 million related to the issuance of the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $2.2 million related to the issuance of the Term Loan due 2020. First Amendment. On December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a first amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013 (“First Amendment”). The First Amendment provides for the incurrence of $125.0 million incremental term loans (“Incremental Term Loan”). In addition, the First Amendment, among other things, (a) extends the maturity date with respect to (i) the existing Term Loan due 2020 and the Incremental Term Loan (together “Term Loan due 2022”) to December 15, 2022 and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility from April 30, 2018 to December 15, 2020 and (b) increases the applicable margin for the Term Loan due 2022 from 1.75% with respect to base rate borrowings to 2.25% and 2.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings to 3.25%. The Company capitalized additional deferred financing costs of approximately $6.5 million related to the modification of the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $3.3 million related to the modification of the term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used by the Company to pay expenses related to the First Amendment transactions and the Starplex Cinemas acquisition. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $1.4 million in other expense (income) during the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted of third-party costs, deferred financing costs, and discount write-off incurred in connection with the modification of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Second Amendment. On November 8, 2016, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013, as previously amended, to among other things, lower the applicable margin on base rate borrowings from 2.25% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on LIBOR borrowings from 3.25% to 2.75%, to reduce the minimum rate for base rate borrowings from 1.75% to 1.00% and the minimum rate for LIBOR rate borrowings to 0.0% and to allow for additional term loan borrowings of $500 million. On November 29, 2016, the Company borrowed $500.0 million additional Term loans due on December 15, 2023 (“Term Loan due 2023”). The Company recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $18.8 million and a discount of 0.25%, or $1.3 million, related to the Term Loan due 2023. The Company used the net proceeds from the Term Loan due 2023 to pay the consideration for the Odeon acquisition and the related refinancing of Odeon debt assumed in the acquisition. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s option, either a base rate or LIBOR. The minimum rate for base rate borrowings is 1.00% and the minimum rate for LIBOR-based borrowings is 0%. The applicable margin for the Terms loan due 2022 and 2023 is 2.00% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for LIBOR based loans. The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.5% for base rate borrowings and from 2.25% to 2.5% for LIBOR based borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee of 0.50% per annum and for letter of credit fees of up to 0.25% per annum plus the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings on the undrawn amount of the letter of credit. The applicable rate for borrowings under the Term Loans due 2022 and 2023 at December 31, 2017 were each 3.727% based on LIBOR (2.75% margin plus 0% minimum LIBOR rate). The Term Loans due 2022 and 2023 requires repayments of principal of 0.25% of the original principal amount, or $3.5 million per quarter, with any remaining balance due on December 15, 2022 or December 15, 2023, as applicable. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans and (ii) in connection with a repricing transaction closed (a) in respect of the Term Loans due 2022, within six months from the date the Second Amendment becomes effective or (b) in respect of the Term Loans due 2023, within six months from the date on which the available commitments of the relevant lenders in respect of the Term Loans due 2023 are reduced to zero, in which case the Company must pay a 1% premium on the amount of Term Loans repaid. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, to sell assets; incur additional indebtedness; prepay other indebtedness (including the notes); pay dividends and distributions or repurchase their capital stock; create liens on assets; make investments; make acquisitions; engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in transactions with affiliates; amend constituent documents and material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, including the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022, the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025; the 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, and the 5.875 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024; change the business conducted by it and its subsidiaries; and enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain, on the last day of each fiscal quarter, a net senior secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, of no more than 3.25 to 1 as long as the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility remain outstanding. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of (i) a change in control, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, (ii) defaults under other indebtedness of the Company, any guarantor or any significant subsidiary having a principal amount of $25.0 million or more, and (iii) one or more uninsured judgments against the Company, any guarantor, or any significant subsidiary for an aggregate amount exceeding $25.0 million with respect to which enforcement proceedings are brought or a stay of enforcement is not in effect for any period of 60 consecutive days. Third Amendment. On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the Third Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Third Amendment decreased the applicable margin for the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement from 1.75% to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.75% to 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The Company expensed $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 for third-party fees related to the Third Amendment to the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On June 13, 2017, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Fourth Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving loan commitment under the Credit Agreement from $150.0 million to $225.0 million. Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement. On August 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc, as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Fifth Amendment”), amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Fifth Amendment made certain changes to certain covenants and definitions. These amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement were executed in order to facilitate an internal reorganization due to recent tax changes and to make modifications which clarified certain ambiguities in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. The cash flows for the term loans due 2022 and 2023 were not changed as a result of the August 14, 2018 modification and the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement was not changed. As a result, the Company has accounted for the Fifth Amendment as a modification. The Company expensed $0.3 million of third-party costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 and capitalized $1.5 million debt issuance costs for amounts paid to lenders. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations (as well as cash management obligations), are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets as well as those of each subsidiary guarantor.

On September 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Silver Lake Alpine, L.P., an affiliate of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (“Silver Lake”), relating to the issuance to Silver Lake (or its designated affiliates) of $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2024.

The right of first refusal applies to both registered and unregistered transfers of shares. Under the ROFR Agreement, in the event that Wanda and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 50.1% of the total voting power of the Company’s voting stock, then the Company will have the same right of first refusal over sales of the Company’s common stock by Wanda as described above until the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date of execution of the ROFR Agreement. In such event, the Company may exercise such right to purchase shares from Wanda from time to time pursuant to the ROFR Agreement in its sole discretion, subject to approval by the disinterested directors of the Board.

With the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda retains voting control of AMC with 75.01% of the voting power of the Company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 8 up to 5,666,000 shares of Class B common stock are subject to forfeiture for no consideration in connection with the reset provision contained in the Indenture. Temporary Equity Certain members of management have the right to require Holdings to repurchase the Class A common stock held by them under certain limited circumstances pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement. Beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on January 1, 2019 (or upon the termination of a management stockholders employment by the Company without cause, by the management stockholder for good reason, or due to the management stockholders death or disability) management stockholders will have the right, in limited circumstances, to require Holdings to purchase shares that are not fully and freely tradeable at a price equal to the price per share paid by such management stockholder with appropriate adjustments for any subsequent events such as dividends, splits, or combinations. The shares of Class A common stock subject to the stockholder agreement are classified as temporary equity, apart from permanent equity, as a result of the contingent redemption feature contained in the stockholder agreement. The Company determined the amount reflected in temporary equity for the Class A common stock-based on the price paid per share by the management stockholders and Wanda on August 30, 2012, the date Wanda acquired Holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one former employee and one current employee who held a total of 37,105 shares relinquished their put rights, therefore the related share amount of $0.4 million was reclassified to additional paid in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a former employee who held 27,197 shares, relinquished his put right, therefore the related amount of $0.3 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2016, a former employee who held 27,197 shares, relinquished his put right, therefore the related amount of $0.2 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity. The stockholders agreement for certain members of management ended on January 1, 2019 and the contingent redemption feature will no longer be operative in calendar 2019. Additional Public Offering On February 13, 2017, the Company completed an additional public offering of 20,330,874 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.50 per share ($640.4 million), resulting in net proceeds of $616.8 million after underwriters commission and other professional fees. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of the Interim Bridge Loan of $350.0 million and general corporate purposes. Treasury Stock On August 3, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a $100.0 million share repurchase program to repurchase its Class A common stock over a two-year period. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time through open-market transactions including block purchases, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise until mid-August 2019 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. The extent to which AMC repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including liquidity, capital needs of the business, market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations, as determined by AMC’s management team. Repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company’s management might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any minimum dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $8.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 3,195,856 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $47.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, $44.3 million remained available for repurchase under this plan. A two-year time limit has been set for the completion of this program, expiring August 2, 2019. Stock-Based Compensation Holdings adopted a stock-based compensation plan in December 2013. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $14.9 million, and $5.7 million, and $6.8 million within general and administrative: other during the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.

NOTE 10 – INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. On the basis of this evaluation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, a valuation allowance of $221.6 million was established domestically on the Company’s net deferred tax assets and considering indefinite-lived intangibles. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income is reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company maintained its valuation allowance. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, limiting the amount of deductible interest expense, limiting executive compensations, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance at December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $121.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit is comprised of $88.6 million of deferred tax expense associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, as reflected in the rate reconciliation, and $210.4 million of deferred tax benefit associated with the partial release of the Company’s valuation allowance as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has assessed the deemed mandatory repatriation provisions of the Tax Reform Act, and is projecting no impact to current year domestic taxable income as it relates to undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company does not intend to distribute earnings in a taxable manner, and therefore intends to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the 100 percent dividends received deduction provided for in the Tax Reform Act, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes. As a result, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. While the Tax Reform Act provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax in the current year and therefore has not included any tax impacts of BEAT in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Income tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components:

The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company determined it is not necessary to accrue interest and penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $15.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively. There are currently, unrecognized tax benefits which the Company anticipates will be resolved in the next 12 months; however, the Company is unable at this time to estimate what the impact on its unrecognized tax benefits will be. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after March 28, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2000, through December 31, 2017, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 12 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans generally covering all employees in the U.S. who, prior to the freeze, were age 21 or older and had completed at least 1,000 hours of service in their first year of employment, or in a calendar year ending thereafter, and who were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company sponsors frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. that were acquired from Odeon on November 30, 2016. The Company sponsors a frozen defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that was acquired from Nordic on March 28, 2017. The Company also offered eligible retirees the opportunity to participate in a health plan. Certain employees were eligible for subsidized postretirement medical benefits. The eligibility for these benefits was based upon a participant’s age and service as of January 1, 2009. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan. The measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefits were December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets’ historical returns, asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management’s best estimate of the long-term prospective return. Cash Flows The Company expects to contribute $4.1 million and $0.0 million to the U.S. and International pension plans, respectively during the calendar year 2019. The following table provides the benefits expected to be paid (inclusive of benefits attributable to estimated future employee service) in each of the next five years, and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter:

Pension Plan Assets The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. The target allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plan The Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, the Company matches 100% of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3% and 50% of contributions up to 5% of the employee’s eligible compensation. The Company’s expense under the 401(k) savings plan was $5.3 million, $4.4 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Iron workers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, asserted claims under some or all of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions and appointed the International Union of Operating Engineers Pension Fund of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as lead plaintiff. On August 13, 2018, lead plaintiff and additional named plaintiff Hawaii Structural Iron Workers Pension Trust Fund (“Plaintiffs”) filed an Amended Class Action Complaint. On November 21, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On August 27, 2018, defendants and the Company as nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On September 17, 2018, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. Due to the variety of remedies available, the Company believes that if the current tenant defaulted on the leases it would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 14 – THEATRE AND OTHER CLOSURE AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS The Company has provided reserves for estimated losses from theatres and screens which have been permanently closed and vacant space with no right to future use. As of December 31, 2018, the Company reserved $18.1 million for lease terminations which have either not been consummated or paid, related primarily to nine theatres and certain vacant restaurant space. The Company is obligated under long-term lease commitments with remaining terms of up to 10 years for theatres which have been closed. As of December 31, 2018, base rents aggregated approximately $5.9 million annually and $18.8 million over the remaining terms of the leases. A rollforward of reserves for theatre and other closure is as follows:

Theatre and other closure expense included the accretion on previously closed properties with remaining lease obligations. In the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, the current portion of the theatre and other closure ending balance of $5.6 million was included with accrued expenses and other liabilities and the long-term portion of the theatre and other closure ending balance of $12.5 million was included with other long-term liabilities. See Note 7 – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information for further information. Theatre and other closure reserves for leases that have not been terminated were recorded at the present value of the future contractual commitments for the base rents, taxes and maintenance. As of December 31, 2018, the future lease obligations are discounted at annual rates ranging from 6.0% to 9.0%. NOTE 15 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:

============================================================

============================================================
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. The equity securities, available-for-sale, primarily consist of common stock and mutual funds invested in equity, fixed income, and international funds and are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. See Note 17 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the unrealized gain on equity securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for level 2 inputs. The level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these Convertible Notes. The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings for further information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. NOTE 16 – OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. Beginning with the Company’s acquisition of Odeon in 2016, the Company has identified two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segments consist of two operating segments (Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres) with operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Denmark. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The two international operating segments, Odeon Theatres and Nordic Theatres, are combined into one reportable segment (International markets) because they have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria described in the accounting guidance for segment reporting. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment:

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision, (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in international markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

(4) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from minority equity investments in theatre operators in certain international markets. See below for a reconciliation of the Company’s equity earnings of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where the Company holds a significant market share, the Company believes attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments. The Company also provides services to these theatre operators including information technology systems, certain on-screen advertising services and our gift card and package ticket program. As these investments relate only to the Company’s Nordic acquisition, the second quarter of 2017 represents the first time the Company has made this adjustment and does not impact prior historical presentations of Adjusted EBITDA.

NOTE 18 – EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of unvested RSU’s with a service condition only and unvested contingently issuable RSUs that have service and performance conditions, if dilutive, as well as potential dilutive shares from the conversion feature of the Convertible Notes due 2024, if dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share:

============================================================

Vested RSUs and PSU’s have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs are subject to performance conditions and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. During the year ended December 31, 2018 unvested PSUs of 364,269 at the minimum performance target were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period and unvested RSU’s of 210,558 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or they would be anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2017 unvested PSUs and Transition PSUs of 187,468 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 88,194 were not included in the computation of diluted loss because they would anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2016, unvested PSUs of 83,477 at the minimum performance target and unvested performance based RSU’s of 90,654 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as vesting conditions were not met at the end of the reporting period. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes due 2024 that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has adjusted net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 to eliminate the interest expense and the gain for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 of $9.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects are dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $18.95 per share the Convertible Notes due 2024 are convertible into 31,662,269 Class A common shares.

Independent Auditor's Report The Members Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, members' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ CohnReznick LLP Roseland, New Jersey February 18, 2019 DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ($in thousands)

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS, LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Nature of Operations Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, ("DCIP", and together with its consolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, the "Company") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 12, 2007 for the purpose of raising third-party capital to purchase and deploy digital cinema projection equipment ("Digital Systems") in theatres located throughout the United States and Canada. The Company will continue in perpetuity. The Company is headquartered in New Jersey and has offices in Colorado and Minnesota. The Company is owned by its founding members American Multi-Cinema, Inc. ("AMC"), Cinemark Media, Inc. ("Cinemark") and Regal/DCIP Holdings, LLC ("Regal") (collectively, the "Founding Members"). On March 10, 2010, the Company completed an initial financing transaction for the deployment of Digital Systems utilizing its subsidiary entities Kasima, LLC ("Kasima"), Kasima Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") and Kasima Parent Holdings, LLC ("Parent") to execute its business plan. Kasima is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Parent is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DCIP. As part of the initial financing transaction, Parent entered into a note purchase agreement with a third-party investment fund. On March 31, 2011, the Company obtained the incremental financing necessary to complete its planned deployment of Digital Systems and on May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced all of its outstanding senior secured debt, extending the term of that debt and lowering its effective interest rate. On March 31, 2014, Parent repaid, in full, the outstanding notes under the note purchase agreement. Digital Systems are purchased by Kasima and leased to each Founding Member or one of its affiliates (each such entity, an "Exhibitor") pursuant to the terms of a Master Equipment Lease Agreement ("ELA"). Kasima facilitates the installation of the leased Digital Systems into each Exhibitor's theatres pursuant to the terms of an Installation Agreement. The Exhibitor is responsible for the ongoing maintenance and insurance of the Digital Systems. The Company has also entered into (and assigned to Kasima) long-term Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements ("DCDAs") with six major motion picture studios ("Major Studios") pursuant to which Kasima receives a virtual print fee ("VPF") each time the studio books a film or certain other content on the Digital Systems. Other content distributors have entered into DCDAs or shorter term agreements with the Company that provide for the payment of VPFs (or as more fully described and defined in Note 2, alternative content fees or "ACFs") to Kasima for bookings of the distributor's content on a Digital System. One such distributor, AC JV, LLC ("Fathom Events"), is related to DCIP through common ownership. On June 20, 2011, DCIP and Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership ("CDCP") entered into a long-term management services agreement (an "MSA" and with respect to CDCP, the "CDCP MSA") to manage a similar deployment of Digital Systems in Canada and to perform certain other specified services for CDCP related thereto (see Note 2). CDCP is a Canadian limited partnership formed by Cineplex Entertainment LP ("Cineplex") and Empire Theatres Ltd. ("Empire") to facilitate the purchase and deployment of Digital Systems to their theatres in Canada. On April 1, 2012, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Cinemark USA, Inc., a Texas corporation and an affiliate of Cinemark, to manage deployment of Digital Systems to theatres operated by its affiliates in Latin America (the "CNI MSA"). On September 1, 2014, DCIP entered into a long-term MSA with Fathom Events to provide it with management and software related services. The services we provide under this agreement have changed from time to time. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DCIP and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. New accounting standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This update is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgements and changes in judgements and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the new standard and related updates on January 1, 2018 and used the modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company reviewed the terms and conditions of its existing customer contracts and applied the five discrete criteria required for recognizing revenue as set forth in ASU 2014-09. Based upon its analysis, the new revenue recognition guidance had no significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not expect this new standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. This guidance requires entities to include in its cash and cash equivalent balances any amounts that are deemed restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this standard retrospectively on January 1, 2018. In August 2017, the FASB amended the requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments will be effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's most significant estimates relate to depreciation and recoverability of property and equipment, amortization, the valuation of derivative agreements and the reimbursement liability concerning equipment warranty and replacement costs under the ELAs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments and consists primarily of money market funds and other overnight investments. The Company maintains bank accounts with major banks, which from time to time may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. Concentration of credit risk For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had three customers that represented 33% and 34%, respectively, of operating revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had four customers that represented 44% of operating revenues. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, four and three customers represented 55% and 39%, respectively, of net accounts receivable. These customers are each parties to DCDAs. None of the Company's other customers individually represented more than 10% of operating revenues or accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 or 2017, or for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable, which consists primarily of amounts owed by the Major Studios and other digital content distributors. The Company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit losses. During 2018, the Company incurred bad debt expense of $4,198,000 related primarily to two studio bankruptcies. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, management has determined that there is no requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Concentration in foreign countries The Company originally leased Digital Systems to AMC (pursuant to its ELA) for theatres located in Canada and receives revenues from CDCP pursuant to the CDCP MSA. In 2013, AMC sold the last of its Canadian theatres and, as a result, the Company no longer leases Digital Systems to AMC in Canada. The revenue previously earned from these operations was paid to the Company in U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenues earned from Canadian sources totaled $1,812,000, $1,799,000 and $1,812,000, respectively. The carrying value of equipment deployed in Canada at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was zero. Revenue earned by the Company under the CNI MSA for theatres located in Latin America was $722,000, $818,000 and $825,000, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fair value and credit risk All current assets and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. The Company's Credit Facility (see Note 7) is comprised of floating rate instruments and management believes fair value approximates carrying value. Property and equipment, net Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
Computer equipment and software 3-5 years Leasehold improvements 5 years Digital cinema projection equipment 17.5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years
============================================================

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Costs for general and administrative expenses, overhead, maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems, are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or other disposition of any property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposal is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Deferred financing costs, net Deferred financing costs are amortized on the interest method basis for the Credit Facility as described in Note 7 and by a charge to interest expense over the term of the Credit Facility and reported as a reduction of long-term debt, net. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $11,713,000 and $10,828,000, respectively. Fair value measurements The Company accounts for and reports the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company applies fair value accounting for financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"): Level 1 :Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 :Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3 :Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions. The following table sets forth, by level, the fair value measurements of the Company's consolidated financial assets ($in thousands): Fair Value Measurements

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
December 31, Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair value of Interest Rate Swap $472 (1) $- $472 $- (1) Reported in derivative assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
============================================================

The fair value of the Company's assets under its Interest Rate Swap (as defined below) is based upon observable market-based inputs that reflect the present values of the difference between estimated future fixed rate payments and future variable receipts and, therefore, is classified within Level 2. The Level 2 fair value of the Company's Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2017 was $1,279,000. Accounting for derivatives In May 2013, the Company terminated an existing swap arrangement and executed new interest rate swap agreements (the "Interest Rate Swap"). Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a component of members' equity) or in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or fair value. The Company determined that the Interest Rate Swap was an effective cash flow hedging instrument through December 31, 2017 and, as a result, changes in the fair value of the Interest Rate Swap are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). During 2018, a portion of the hedge was designated as ineffective and an immaterial amount was recognized as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income taxes The Company is a limited liability company and, as such, is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, as a partnership for tax purposes, the Company is not a taxable entity for federal income taxes and is not subject to significant state income taxes. However, the Company does pay certain state taxes based on revenue or net income that are reported as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Income or loss of the Company as a limited liability company is reported to and included in the individual income tax returns of its members. Tax years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities with regard to the allocation of income or losses by the Company to its members. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or conditions exist that indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for recoverability is based primarily on the Company's ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If the total of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the total carrying value of an asset, the asset is deemed not to be recoverable and possibly impaired. The Company then estimates the fair value of the asset to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the expected future discounted cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Revenue recognition The Company has analyzed the provisions of the FASB's ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and has concluded that no changes are necessary to conform with the new standard. The majority of the Company's revenues are VPFs from Major Studios under the DCDAs. The Company earns VPF revenue when movies and certain other content distributed by Major Studios and other content distributors are booked and exhibited on screens utilizing the Company's Digital Systems. VPFs are earned and payable based on a fee schedule outlined in the DCDAs and other VPF agreements. The VPF revenue is recognized in the period in which it is earned, generally the first time the content is booked and exhibited in the theatre auditorium for which a Digital System has been installed. The DCDAs with the Major Studios require the payment of VPFs for a period that ends on the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" for all Digital Systems scheduled to be deployed over a period of up to five years, or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. Cost recoupment occurs when revenues attributable to the Digital Systems exceed the costs associated with their purchase (including financing), deployment, administration and other allowed amounts, all as defined in the DCDAs. In addition to VPF revenue, the Company also earns a fee each time certain digital content other than feature films (e.g., concerts, sporting events and opera performances) is booked and exhibited on a Digital System. The Company refers to fees derived on a per-exhibition basis from these alternative forms of digital content as alternative content fees ("ACFs"). ACFs may be paid by the distributor of the alternative content pursuant to an agreement with the Company or by the Exhibitor showing the content pursuant to its ELA. ACF revenue is recognized in the period in which the alternative content is exhibited. Lease revenues in respect of the Digital Systems and certain other rental and usage fees are earned by the Company in accordance with the terms of the ELAs. All amounts due to the Company under these agreements are recognized as revenue when earned and any unearned amounts are recorded as deferred revenue. The initial lease term for each piece of equipment deployed under the ELAs begins on the date the equipment is placed in service and continues for 12 years, with the first and last month incurring one-half of the monthly lease payment otherwise due. The Company generates multiple revenue streams from the leased Digital Systems under the ELAs as follows: Lease fees are payable by the Exhibitors monthly and prior to March 31, 2014 were comprised of a fixed base lease rate plus a "step-up" rate component for all equipment (regardless of lease commencement date) that was to occur on October 1, 2016. The Company recognized lease revenue from these fees on a straight-line method making an allowance for the step-up in rent that was to occur. On March 31, 2014, the ELAs were amended to remove the scheduled step-up lease payments. The accumulated effects of the amendments are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction in revenue over the remaining terms of the ELAs. Contingent rent may be due under the ELAs if total revenues in respect of the Digital Systems deployed thereunder (calculated quarterly on a rolling last twelve-month basis) fail to meet certain minimum revenue thresholds. The minimum revenue thresholds were prorated for the initial four quarters of the ELAs. Contingent rent, if any, is calculated and recognized monthly, but billed and paid quarterly. No Contingent rent was due for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Peak period payments are due under the ELAs when the leased Digital Systems are taken out of service by an Exhibitor for one or more consecutive defined "peak periods" (generally a weekend) as a result of relocation, damage or a complex closing. Peak period payments, if any, are recognized, billed and paid monthly. In accordance with the ELAs, the Exhibitors are required to acquire extended warranties with respect to the leased Digital Systems covering the period from the expiration of the initial included manufacturer's warranty through the date of repayment of the Credit Facility (the "Warranty End Date"), but in no event later than 12 years from the effective date of the ELAs. Following the Warranty End Date, the Exhibitors may choose to continue extended warranty coverage through the expiration of the DCDAs (the "DCDA End Date"). The DCDA End Date will occur on the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the "mean deployment date" of the Digital Systems or (ii) the date the Company achieves "cost recoupment", each as defined in the DCDAs. The Company expects that the Exhibitors will maintain extended warranty coverage through the DCDA End Date. Pursuant to the ELAs, the Company is required to reimburse the Exhibitor for the costs of the extended warranties (and/or equipment replacement costs) subject to quarterly caps set forth in the ELAs. This contractual obligation by the Company to incur costs at a future date for the extended warranties or replacement costs when the leased equipment is purchased creates a liability at the purchase date and a contra revenue adjustment in respect of revenues derived under the ELAs that is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company also earns revenues in respect of the services DCIP provides under the MSAs. The revenues are earned ratably as the services are performed under the agreement. Subsequent events The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 18, 2019, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Note 3 - Financing Transactions On May 17, 2013, the Company refinanced its then outstanding senior secured debt, extending its term and lowering its effective interest rate. The transaction consisted of a $755,000,000 senior secured loan commitment (the Credit Facility described in Note 7) to Kasima from a group of commercial banks and institutional investors. Note 4 - Consolidated Balance Sheet Components Restricted cash The Company had restricted cash of $3,702,000 and $5,891,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in the form of an interest reserve escrow account related to the Credit Facility (see Note 7) and an excess cost escrow account for the funding of Digital Systems in excess of costs caps established in the related credit agreement.

Note 7- Long-term Debt, net Credit facilities On May 17, 2013, DCIP, Holdings and Kasima entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC as Administrative Agent and a group of lenders which agreed to provide Kasima a $75 million revolving line of credit ("Revolver") and a $680 million term loan ("Term Loan B" and together with the Revolver, the "Credit Facility"). The Term Loan B was fully funded at the closing of the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Term Loan B were used to repay all amounts under the then outstanding credit facility and to repay fees, transaction costs and other expenses incurred in connection with such repayment and the establishment of the Credit Facility. All costs of Digital Systems exceeding established caps must be funded by capital contributions from the Founding Members. The Revolver was available, subject to certain conditions, through May 17, 2018, its maturity date, at which time no amounts were outstanding. The maturity date of the Term Loan B is May 17, 2021 (the "Term Loan B Maturity Date"). At December 31, 2017, the Revolver was undrawn. The Term Loan B borrowings bear interest, at the option of Kasima, at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate, each as defined in the Credit Facility, plus the defined Applicable Rate, which is 1.50% in the case of borrowings based on the Alternate Base Rate and 2.50% for borrowings based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate. The Term Loan B is further subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 0.75%. The commitment fee on undrawn amounts in respect of the Revolver was 0.50% per annum through its maturity date. The Term Loan B amortizes at 1.25% of its original principal amount per annum, payable in quarterly increments of $8.5 million commencing on September 30, 2014 with the remaining balance, including any unpaid interest and fees, payable on the Term Loan B Maturity Date. Prepayments of the Term Loan B reduce future mandatory amortization payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Commencing with the defined Test Date in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and annually on each Test Date thereafter, Kasima will prepay Term Loan B borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of defined Excess Cash Flow (generally the amount by which Cash Flow from Operations exceeds Consolidated Fixed Charges, each as defined, for the prior fiscal year). Kasima may at any time terminate or permanently reduce commitments under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty in $5 million increments of not less than $20 million. The "Borrower" under the Credit Facility is Kasima and the Credit Facility is guaranteed by Holdings and each direct or indirect subsidiary of Holdings other than the Borrower. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets of the Company (with certain negotiated exclusions), including contract rights, cash and securities accounts and the Digital Systems on Exhibitors' premises. Under the Credit Facility, the Borrower is required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. Material covenants included an interest coverage ratio, minimum average revenues per deployed screen, capital expenditure limitations and excess cash flow. At December 31, 2018, the Company had excess cash flow of $3.4 million which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2018, the Borrower was in compliance with all of its Credit Facility covenants. On September 27, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended to allow Kasima to make up to $20.0 million in distributions each fiscal year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including having revenue per average screen of no less than $12,475 for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period prior to any such distribution. As part of the same amendment, the Revolver was reduced from $75.0 million to $35.0 million. Following the effective date of the amendment in 2016, Kasima is making an annual distribution of $20.0 million to its member. The Company's long-term debt consists of the Term Loan B with balances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $70.0 million and $195.0 million, respectively, and interest rates of 5.26% and 4.17%, respectively.

Derivatives The Interest Rate Swap contracts were entered into for interest expense cost protection from rising variable interest rates and are associated with the Company's Term Loan B which matures on May 17, 2021. Under the Interest Rate Swap contracts, the Company receives current market LIBO Rate interest payments, subject to an interest rate floor for the Term Loan B of 0.75% per annum, and pays a fixed rate of 1.29% calculated on the same notional principal amount (the "Notional Swap Amount") which changes for each fiscal quarter commencing as of the quarter ended June 30, 2013 and terminating on the contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. The Notional Swap Amount for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2018 was $68,127,000 and the then-current market LIBO Rate interest was (1.52%) per annum.
