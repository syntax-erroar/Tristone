​ ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

​ ​ Goodwill Impairment ​ Description of the Matter ​ The Company assigns goodwill acquired in business combinations to its reporting units as of each acquisition date. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill balance related to the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was approximately $1.797 billion and $751 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized impairments of $1.276 billion and $1.030 billion to the Domestic Theatre and International Theatre reporting units, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Auditing management’s goodwill impairment assessments for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate and projected future revenues which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the prospective financial information (PFI) for the quantitative analysis. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the valuation was complete and accurate. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by the Company to current industry and economic trends, including the impact of COVID-19, while also considering changes to the Company’s business model, forecasts used in the Company’s annual operating plans and other relevant factors. In addition, we evaluated the competency and objectivity of management's qualified persons and third-party specialists through consideration of their professional qualifications, experience, objectivity, and their use of accepted industry practices. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the Company’s significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates. We reconciled the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount, testing the Company’s determination of the assets and liabilities used within the reporting units that are the basis for the carrying amount.

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Liquidity – Impact of COVID-19 ​ Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to the global pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended all theatre operations in its U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of the Company’s guests and theatre staff. The Company resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal government restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. The North American and International industry box offices have also have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, and in response to the suspension of theatre operations by the Company and other theatre exhibitors and the COVID-19 related suspension of new movie production, studios have postponed new film releases beyond 2020 or moved them to the home video market. As a result of these temporarily suspended operations and limited new film content, the Company’s revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 are significantly lower than the revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management determined that the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on their operations will continue to have a material negative impact on their financial results and liquidity. Management has taken

============================================================
actions to improve the Company’s liquidity, including reductions to the Company’s fixed cost structure, negotiating deferrals and/or abatements of theatre rent, and the execution of capital market transactions including debt issuances, debt exchanges and equity sales. Based on these actions and considering the Company’s available liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $308 million at December 31, 2020, management concluded there is sufficient liquidity to meet minimum liquidity requirements, fund operations, and satisfy the Company’s obligations for at least the next twelve months. The principal assumptions used in management’s cash flow analyses used to estimate future liquidity requirements consisted of: the continued vaccine rollout; release and supply of Hollywood theatrical product; the expected increase in attendance levels; and the impacts of home video or streaming markets. We determined the Company’s assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment by management when evaluating the uncertainty related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s financial results and liquidity. In particular, there is a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s liquidity assessment to determine that the Company will be able to satisfy its obligations as they become due for 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested controls over the Company’s going concern assessment process. For example, we tested controls involving management’s review of significant assumptions in the liquidity analysis. Further, we tested management’s process for forecasting financial results and liquidity for one year after the date the financial statements are issued and tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the forecast. We independently assessed the sensitivity and impact of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and estimates included in management’s cash flow forecasts and liquidity position and compared those results to the sensitivity analyses performed by management. We evaluated management’s disclosure in the consolidated financial statements that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations for at least the next twelve months.

​ ​ ​ ​ Valuation of operating lease liabilities Description of the Matter ​ At December 31, 2020, the Company’s operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities were $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. As discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) for operating leases. Since most of the leases do not provide a determinable implicit rate, the Company estimated its IBR used to calculate its right of use assets and lease liabilities. Auditing the Company’s estimate of the IBR was especially challenging as it involved a high degree of subjective judgment when testing the reasonableness of the inputs and appropriateness of the rates applied to each lease. In particular, the estimate of the IBR is sensitive to significant assumptions such as determination of current credit rating and selection of associated yield curve. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination of the IBR. For example, we tested management’s review controls over this process. To test the Company’s determination of the IBR, our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of management’s methodology for developing the IBR and a comparison of certain assumptions used by management to our independent estimates which were developed with the assistance of our specialists. ​ ​ ​

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Kansas City, Missouri March 12, 2021 ​ ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ​ To the Stockholders and Board of Directors AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

(“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2020, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate, owned approximately 23.08 % of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 47.37 % of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and had significant influence over Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets and other extraordinary transactions. On February 1, 2021, Wanda exercised their right to convert all outstanding Class B common stock to Class A common stock resulting in ownership in Holdings’ outstanding common stock and voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock of approximately 9.8 % as of March 3, 2021. Temporarily Suspended Operations. As of March 17, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended all theatre operations in its U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of the Company’s guests and theatre staff. The Company resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal government restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. The North American and International industry box offices have also have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, and in response to the suspension of theatre operations by the Company and other theatre exhibitors and the COVID-19 related suspension of new movie production, studios have postponed new film releases beyond 2020 or moved them to the home video market. As a result of these temporarily suspended operations and limited new film content, the Company’s revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 are significantly lower than the revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Liquidity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken and continues to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, including reductions to the Company’s variable and elements of its fixed cost structure, including, but not limited to:

The Company intends to seek any available potential benefits, including loans, investments or guarantees, under future government programs for which the Company qualifies domestically and internationally. The Company has taken advantage of many forms of governmental assistance internationally including but not limited to revenue and fixed cost reimbursements, payroll subsidies, rent support programs, direct grants, and property tax holidays. The Company cannot predict the manner in which such benefits will be allocated or administered, and the Company cannot assure it will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. In addition to preserving cash, the Company enhanced liquidity through debt issuance, debt exchanges and equity sales as follows.

============================================================
● The February 2021 entry into a new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million term loan facility agreement (the “Odeon Term Loan Facility”) by Odeon Cinemas Group Limited (“Odeon”). Approximately £ 89.7 million and € 12.8 million of the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility was used to repay in full Odeon’s obligations (including principal, interest, fees and cash collateralized letters of credit) under its existing revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes .
============================================================

If attendance levels increase consistent with our assumptions described below, it currently estimates that its existing cash and cash equivalents, net proceeds from the completed issuances of debt and common stock in January 2021 and borrowings under the Odeon Term Loan Facility in February 2021 will be sufficient to comply with minimum liquidity requirements under our debt covenants, fund operations, and satisfy obligations including cash outflows for increased rent and planned capital expenditures currently and through at least March 31, 2022. This requires that the Company achieves significant increases in attendance levels beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and ultimately reaching 90 % of pre COVID-19 attendance levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 and through the first quarter of 2022, as the vaccine rollout continues and more Hollywood product is released in its theatres. The Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (as defined below) to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the suspension period for the financial covenant applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein. As a result, the Company will be subject to the financial covenant beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2022. The Company is subject to minimum liquidity requirements of approximately $145 million of which $100 million is required under the conditions for the Extended Covenant Suspension Period under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility during the Extended Covenant Suspension Period, as amended, and £ 32.5 million (approximately $45 million) required under the Odeon Term Loan Facility. The Company’s liquidity needs thereafter will depend, among other things, on the timing of a full resumption of operations, the timing of movie releases and its ability to generate cash from operations. The Company continues to explore potential sources of additional liquidity, which is essential to its long-term viability, including:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Additional equity financing. The Company may continue to pursue equity issuances that include its remaining authorized shares. The amount of liquidity the Company might generate will primarily depend on the market price of its Class A common stock, trading volumes, which impact the number of shares the Company is able to sell, and the available periods during which sales may be made. Because the Company’s market price and trading volumes are volatile, there is no guarantee as to the amounts of liquidity it might generate or that its prior experience accurately predicts the results the Company will achieve.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Landlord Negotiations . Commencing in 2021, the Company’s cash expenditures for rent are scheduled to increase significantly as a result of rent obligations that had been deferred to 2021 and future years that were approximately $450.0 million as of December 31, 2020. In light of the Company’s liquidity challenges, and in order to establish its long-term viability, the Company believes it must continue to reach accommodations with its landlords to abate or defer a substantial portion of the Company’s rent obligations, in addition to generating sufficient amounts of liquidity through equity issuances and the other potential financing arrangements discussed below. Accordingly, the Company has entered into additional landlord negotiations to seek material reductions, abatements and deferrals in its rent obligations. In connection with these negotiations, the Company has ceased to make rent payments under a portion of its leases and has received notices of default, the result of which may permit landlords to threaten or seek a variety of remedies. The Company continues to renegotiate leases with landlords to attain additional concessions and address any instances of default. To the extent the Company achieves substantial deferrals but not abatements, its cash requirements will increase substantially in the future.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Other Creditor Discussions . While the liquidity the Company has raised has substantially extended its liquidity runway, the new debt the Company has issued or that has been committed, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase its leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like the Company’s deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to its long-term viability if its operating income does not return to pre-COVID levels. Even then, the Company believes it will need to engage in discussions with its creditors to substantially reduce its leverage. The Company expects to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage its leverage but would be dilutive to holders of its common stock. The Company expects it will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.

● Joint-venture or other arrangements with existing business partners and minority investments in the Company’s capital stock. The Company continues to explore other potential arrangements, including equity investments, to generate additional liquidity.
============================================================

It is very difficult to estimate the Company’s liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates and future attendance levels. Depending on the Company’s assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve more normalized levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when theatre attendance levels will normalize, which the Company expects will depend on the widespread availability and use of effective vaccines for the coronavirus. However, the Company’s current cash burn rates are not sustainable. Further, the Company cannot predict what future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition once moviegoers are prepared to return in large numbers. Nor can the Company know with certainty the impact of Warner Bros.’s announcement that it is releasing its entire 2021 slate of movies on HBO Max at the same time as the movies debut in theatres or any similar announcements regarding the release of movie titles concurrently to the home video or streaming markets, as those arrangements will be subject to negotiations that have not yet taken place. There can be no assurance that the attendance level and other assumptions used to estimate the Company’s liquidity requirements and future cash burn will be correct, and its ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet its obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to maintain or renegotiate its minimum liquidity covenant requirements, it could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company also realized significant cancellation of debt income (“CODI”) in connection with its debt restructuring. As a result of such CODI, the Company estimates a significant portion of its net operating losses and tax credits will be eliminated as a result of tax attribute reductions. Any loss of tax attributes as a result of such CODI may adversely affect the Company’s cash flows and therefore its ability to service its indebtedness. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company manages its business under two reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Noncontrolling Interests. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders’ equity, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. On August 28, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU, which consists of nine theatres located in the Baltics’ region (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and is included in the Company’s International markets reportable segment, for total consideration of approximately € 77.25 million, including cash of approximately € 64.35 million or $76.6 million prior to any transaction costs. This transaction was undertaken by the Company to further increase its liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet at a transaction multiple that demonstrates that market participants ascribe positive value to the business. The completion of the sale will take place in several steps and is contingent upon clearance from each regulatory competition council in each country. The Company received $37.5 million (€ 31.53 million) cash consideration upon entering into the sale agreement on August 28, 2020, transferred an equity interest of 49 % in Forum Cinemas OU to the purchaser and recorded an initial noncontrolling interest of $34.9 million in total equity (deficit). Transaction costs of $1.4 million and net gain of $1.2 million related to the sale of 49 % equity interest of Lithuania and Estonia and the 100 % disposal of Latvia were recorded in additional paid-in capital during the year ended December 31, 2020 and will be recognized in earnings when the remaining 51 % interests in Lithuania and Estonia are disposed. At December 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group that were previously included in the International markets reportable segment were; goodwill of $41.8 million, property, net, of $13.0 million, operating lease right-of-use assets, net of $15.7 million, and current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $2.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. The remaining cash consideration is payable upon completion of the sale of the remaining 51 % equity interest in Lithuania and Estonia, which is expected to occur in two separate transactions by country following competition council clearance in each country. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s noncontrolling interest of 49 % in Lithuania and Estonia was $26.9 million. The Company estimates the sale of Forum Cinemas will be completed in 2021. Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recorded at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers 100 % of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. The Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (“proportional method”) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from 13 % to 18.5 % of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month’s sales as income over the next 24 months in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using data accumulated over ten years. Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The Company believes it is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. Film Exhibition Costs. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded film payables of $16.4 million and $166.5 million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Food and Beverage Costs. The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned. Exhibitor Services Agreement. The Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”) with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company’s theatre screens and attendees through February 2037. Upon adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018, the Company’s advertising revenues have significantly increased with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 606 and pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 6 — Investments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration. The interest expense was calculated using discount rates that ranged from 6.5 % to 18.25 %, which are the rates at which the Company believes it could borrow in separate financing transactions. Customer Engagement Programs. AMC Stubs ® is a customer loyalty program in the U.S. markets which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere TM , with a $15.00 annual membership fee, and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs ® Insider TM . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. The Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program’s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire. AMC Stubs ® A-List is the Company’s monthly subscription-based tier of the AMC Stubs ® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies for $19.95 and $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. Advertising Costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were $10.7 million, $42.6 million, and $45.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Equivalents. All highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Derivative Asset and Liability. The Company remeasured the derivative asset related to its contingent call option to acquire shares of its Class B common stock at no additional cost and the derivative liability related to the conversion feature in its Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 at fair value each reporting period until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense (income). The Company has obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation studies use a Monte Carlo simulation approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Company’s common stock price at the end of each reporting period as well as the remaining amount of time until expiration for the contingent call option and conversion feature are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. The Company recorded other expense (income) related to derivative asset fair value adjustments of $19.6 million, $17.7 million and $(45.0) million, during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and other expense (income) related to derivative liability fair value adjustments of $89.4 million, $(23.5) million, and $(66.4) million, during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations and Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity for further discussions. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets were recorded at fair value for intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and other theatre acquisitions. Intangible assets are comprised of amounts assigned to management contracts, a contract with an equity method investee, and a non-compete agreement, each of which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $15.2 million in the International markets. There were no intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Investments. The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company’s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment expense (income). Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note 6 — Investments for further discussion of the Company’s investments in NCM. As of December 31, 2020, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a 18.3 % interest in SV Holdco LLC (“SV Holdco”), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a 50.0 % interest in Digital CineMedia Ltd. (“DCM”), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a 32.0 % interest in AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a 29.0 % interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in the Company’s theatres; a 14.6 % interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a 10.0 % interest in SCC; a 50 % ownership interest in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50 % ownership interest in 54 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. In 2020, the Company early adopted the amendments in S-X Rule 1-02(w) related to significant subsidiary tests of nonconsolidated entities. Goodwill. The Company’s recorded goodwill was $2,547.3 million and $4,789.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings by Wanda on August 30, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company evaluates goodwill recorded at the Company’s two reporting units (Domestic Theatres and International Theatres). Also, the Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment test for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A decline in the common stock price and prices of the Company’s corporate borrowings and the resulting impact on market capitalization are two of several factors considered when making this evaluation. Based on sustained declines during the first quarter of 2020 in the Company’s enterprise market capitalization and the temporary suspension of operations at all the Company’s theatres on or before March 17, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of March 31, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units were less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $1,124.9 million and $619.4 million, respectively, were recorded as of March 31, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of September 30, 2020. Due to the suspension of operations during the second and third quarters of 2020 and the further delay or cancellation of film releases, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units was less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment charges of $151.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were recorded as of September 30, 2020 for the Company’s Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units. Due to the further delay or cancellation of film releases and the further suspension of operations in the International markets, the Company performed a Step 1 quantitative impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of December 31, 2020. In performing the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2020, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting units. See Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the valuation methodology. The enterprise fair value of the Domestic Theatres reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and the enterprise fair value of the International Theatre reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, goodwill impairment charge of $405.3 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020 for the Company’s International Theatres reporting unit. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and discount rates to be used in determining fair value, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Given the nature of the Company’s business and its recent history, future impairments are possible based upon business conditions, movie release dates, and attendance levels. As of September 30, 2019 and based on recent sustained declines in the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Domestic and International reporting units as of September 30, 2019. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, the Company used an enterprise value approach to measure fair value of the reporting. The enterprise fair values of the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 9.9 % and 11.8 %, respectively. Accordingly, there was no goodwill impairment recorded as of September 30, 2019. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were any events or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis as of December 31, 2019. Given the further decline in the Company’s stock price during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its two reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts as of December 31, 2019. The Company compared its projected financial information and assumptions utilized in the quantitative analysis as of September 30, 2019 to the fourth quarter results noting operating performance is consistent with the projections and there have been no other changes which would impact management’s conclusion that the fair values of its reporting units exceed their carrying values. The Company also observed that its estimated fair value of its corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations remained relatively consistent from September 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019, which represents approximately 80 % of the Company’s market enterprise value. The Company observed higher enterprise value control premiums for a recent acquisition agreement in its industry than those utilized for the market approach. In considering the totality of the aforementioned factors together with the excess of fair value over carrying value calculated in both its reporting units in the previous impairment test, the Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its two reporting units have been reduced below their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company concluded that an interim quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2019 was not required. Other Long-term Assets. Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures, costs incurred in connection with the Company’s line-of-credit revolving credit arrangement, which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the respective life of the issuance, and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 7 — Supplemental Balance Sheet Information. Accounts Payable. Under the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $1.8 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2018. Upon transition to the new standard, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The majority of the Company’s operations are conducted in premises occupied under lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 12 to 15 years , with certain leases containing options to extend the leases for up to an additional 20 years . The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recorded at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years , which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of food and beverage equipment. Sale Leaseback Transactions. Prior to adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the Company deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions and amortized the gains over the remaining lease term. Losses on sale leaseback transactions were recorded at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the net book value of the property. On June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale leaseback of the real estate assets associated with one theatre for proceeds, net of closing costs, of $50.1 million and the deferred gain on the sale was approximately $27.3 million. Upon adoption ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the unamortized deferred gains related to sales leaseback transactions of $102.4 million were reclassified as a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. Impairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of theatre assets may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value, with the difference recorded as an impairment charge. Assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note 12 — Fair Value Measurements. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets that were impaired: ​

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of long-lived assets of $152.5 million on 101 theatres in the U.S. markets with 1,139 screens (in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming) and $25.4 million on 37 theatres in the International markets with 340 screens (in Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and UK), which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to definite-lived intangible assets of $14.4 million in the U.S. markets. For indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Company recorded impairment charges related to the Odeon trade name of $12.5 million and Nordic trade names of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses in the International markets related to equity method investments of $8.6 million in equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $15.9 million within investment expense (income), related to equity interest investments without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method in the U.S. markets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $76.6 million on 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens and an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $7.7 million on 14 theatres with 148 screens in the International markets, which was related to property held and used, operating lease right-of-use assets, and a U.S. property held and not used in other long-term assets. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million within investment expense (income), related to an equity interest investment without a readily determinable fair value accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets loss of $13.8 million on 13 theatres in the U.S. markets with 150 screens and 15 theatres with 118 screens in the International markets which was related to property held and used. Foreign Currency Translation. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings (loss), except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, and also the Company’s £ 4.0 million, 6.375 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which have been designated as a non-derivative net investment hedge of the Company’s investment in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”). If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation or transaction balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded as part of a gain or loss on disposition. Employee Benefit Plans. The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., and a defined benefit pension plan in Sweden that is not frozen. The Company also sponsors a postretirement deferred compensation plan and a defined contribution plan. The following table sets forth the plans’ benefit obligations and plan assets and the accrued liability for benefit costs included in the consolidated balance sheets: ​

​ The offset to the pension liability is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. For further information, see Note 14—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for pension amounts and activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, net periodic benefit costs were $1.8 million, $1.7 million, and $1.1 million, respectively. The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is recorded in general and administrative other and the non-operating component is recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table provides the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years, and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter: ​

​ The Company’s investment objectives for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments are: (1) to preserve the value of its principal; (2) to maximize a real long-term return with respect to the plan assets consistent with minimizing risk; (3) to achieve and maintain adequate asset coverage for accrued benefits under the plan; and (4) to maintain sufficient liquidity for payment of the plan obligations and expenses. The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan’s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: U.S. equity securities of 43 %, fixed including U.S. treasury securities and bond market funds of 27 %, international equity securities of 23 %, and private real estate of 7 %. The international pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation. Investments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2020, for the U.S. investment portfolio, 95 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and 5 % of the investment included pooled separate accounts valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2020, for the International investment portfolio 2 % consisting of cash and equivalents was valued using quoted market prices from actively traded markets (Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), 37 % included pooled separate accounts and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), and 61 % were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Under the defined contribution plan, the Company sponsors a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering certain U.S. employees age 21 or older and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan, except during the 2020 furlough period, the Company matched 100 % of each eligible employee’s elective contributions up to 3 % and 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of the employee’s eligible compensation. Income and Operating Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10. Under ASC 740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. Holdings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate. Casualty Insurance. The Company is self-insured for general liability up to $1.0 million per occurrence and carries a $0.5 million deductible limit per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $32.7 million and $29.4 million. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers’ compensation claims of $32.8 million, $32.6 million, and $25.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense. Other Expense (Income): The following table sets forth the components of other expense (income): ​

​ Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance impacts how the Company determines its allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and also contingent lease guarantees, where the Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. The Company recorded the cumulative effect upon adoption of the new standard related to credit losses for contingent lease guarantees of $16.9 million. See Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies for further information regarding contingent lease guarantees. The adoption impact on the Company’s allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables was immaterial as of January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. The cumulative effect of adoption was recorded to accumulated deficit under the modified retrospective adoption method. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy but are required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant observable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASU 2018-13 were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 12—Fair Value Measurements for the required disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. Cloud Computing Arrangement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation, setup, and other upfront costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. ASU 2018-15 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10-45. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 prospectively and the adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is intended to improve consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis for goodwill. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and the applicable adoption method to be utilized. ​ NOTE 2—REVENUE RECOGNITION ​ Disaggregation of Revenue.

As the Company reopened theatres during the three months ended September 30, 2020, A-list members had the option to reactivate their subscription, which restarted the monthly charge for the program. The Company resumed the recognition of deferred revenues related to certain loyalty programs, gift cards and exchange tickets as operations resumed.

​ Gift cards and exchange tickets. The total amount of non-redeemed gift cards and exchange tickets included in deferred revenues and income as of December 31, 2020 was $319.7 million. This will be recognized as revenues as the gift cards and exchange tickets are redeemed or as the non-redeemed gift card and exchange ticket revenues are recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months . Loyalty programs. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of deferred revenue allocated to the loyalty programs included in deferred revenues and income was $67.0 million. The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next 24 months . The AMC Stubs Premiere TM annual membership fee is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. NOTE 3—LEASES The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably certain at the lease commencement and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Equipment leases primarily consist of digital projectors and food and beverage equipment. The following is the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019:

The Company received, or is in process of negotiating, rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided, or will aid, in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19. These concessions primarily consist of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. In instances where there were no substantive changes to the lease terms, i.e., modifications that resulted in total payments of the modified lease being substantially the same or less than the total payments of the existing lease, the Company elected the relief as provided by the FASB staff related to the accounting for certain lease concessions. The Company elected not to account for these concessions as a lease modification, and therefore the Company has remeasured the related lease liability and right of use asset but did not reassess the lease classification or change the discount rate to the current rate in effect upon the remeasurement. The deferred payment amounts have been recorded in the Company’s lease liabilities to reflect the change in the timing of payments. The deferred payment amounts included in current maturities of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Those leases that did not meet the criteria for treatment under the FASB relief were evaluated as lease modifications. The deferred payment amounts included in accounts payable for contractual rent amounts due and not paid are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of the change in accounts payable. In addition, the Company included deferred lease payments in operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of lease remeasurements.

The estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and buildings subject to a ground lease reflect the shorter of the expected useful lives of the assets or the base terms of the corresponding lease agreements plus renewal options expected to be exercised for these leases for assets placed in service subsequent to the lease inception. The estimated useful lives are as follows: ​

FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ Buildings and improvements 1 to 40 years Leasehold improvements ​ 1 to 20 years ​ Furniture, fixtures and equipment ​ 1 to 15 years ​
============================================================

​ Expenditures for additions (including interest during construction) and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses resulting from property disposals are included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation expense was $453.2 million, $413.6 million, and $498.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. ​ NOTE 5—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ​ The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by reporting unit: ​

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS ​ Investments in non-consolidated affiliates and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than 50 % voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2020, include interests in DCIP of 29.0 %, DCDC of 14.6 %, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of 32.0 %, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, 18.3 %, DCM of 50.0 %, and SCC of 10.0 %. The Company also has partnership interests in three U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately 50.0 % interest in 54 theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. NCM Transactions Pursuant to the Company’s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula (“Common Unit Adjustment”), primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of 2 % or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment or (b) pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member’s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement. In March 2018, the NCM Common Unit Adjustment ("CUA") resulted in a negative adjustment of 915,150 common units for the Company. The Company elected to return the units and recorded the surrendered common units as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $5.2 million, based upon a price per share of NCM, Inc. of $5.64 on March 15, 2018. The Company’s investment in NCM was reduced by the carrying value of the common units of $6.3 million resulting in a loss from the surrender of the NCM common units of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity in earnings (loss) of Non-Consolidated Entities in March 2018. In June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, it reduced the Company’s then ownership of common stock shares in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM to zero. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5 %. The Company recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In March 2019, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 197,118 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $1.4 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $7.24 on March 14, 2019. In March 2020, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of 1,390,566 common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at fair value of $4.8 million, based upon a price per share of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) of $3.46 on March 12, 2020. The Company does not have significant influence over this entity and the investment is recorded at fair value each period. DCIP Transactions The Company received distributions from DCIP in in the fourth quarter of 2020 of digital projectors it had been leasing with an estimated fair value of $125.2 million, which the Company recorded as a reduction to its investment in DCIP. The distribution reduced the Company’s recorded investment below $0 and therefore the Company recorded equity in earnings of $5.1 million to increase its investment to $0 as the Company has not guaranteed any of the liabilities of DCIP. The Company will not record its share of any equity in earnings of DCIP until such time as the excess distribution amount recorded to earnings has been satisfied with prospective earnings from DCIP. AC JV Transactions On December 26, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned 32 % by each of the Founding Members and 4 % by NCM. In consideration for the spin-off, NCM received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from its Founding Members (approximately $8.3 million from each Founding Member). Interest on the promissory note is at a fixed rate of 5 % per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments were due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing. The Company paid the sixth and final annual installment related to the promissory note in December 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the “Digital ESAs”) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. SV Holdco. (“Screenvision”) The Company acquired its investment in SV Holdco on December 21, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. SV Holdco is a holding company that owns and operates the Screenvision advertising business through a subsidiary entity. SV Holdco has elected to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 30, 2018, Screenvision entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision. The Company received distributions and merger consideration of $45.8 million on July 2, 2018 upon consummation of the Screenvision merger and retains a 18.2 % common membership interest. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in Screenvision to $0 and recorded equity in earnings for the excess distribution of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Summary Financial Information Investments in non-consolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2020, include interests in SV Holdco, DCM, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC, SCC, 54 theatres in Europe, three U.S. motion picture theatres, and other immaterial investments.

Entry into Material Definitive Agreements Mudrick Transaction. On December 10, 2020, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Mudrick Capital Management, LP (“Mudrick”), pursuant to which Mudrick committed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the payment of the Commitment Shares (as defined below) and consummation of the Second Lien Exchange (as defined below), to purchase $100 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 to be issued by the Company. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information regarding the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026. On December 14, 2020, Mudrick received a total of 21,978,022 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock; of which 8,241,758 shares (“Commitment Shares”) relates to consideration received for a commitment fee and 13,736,264 shares (“Exchange Shares”) as consideration received for the second lien exchange. Mudrick exchanged $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 that were held by Mudrick for the Exchange Shares (the “Second Lien Exchange”) and waived its claim to PIK interest of $4.5 million principal amount. The fair value of 21,978,022 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock was $70.1 million based on the market closing price of $3.19 per share on December 14, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Class A common shares issued were recorded by the Company in stockholders’ deficit with an offset in other long term assets as a discount of $26.3 million for the Commitment Shares and as consideration of $43.8 million for the Second Lien Exchange. The discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 of $93.6 million based on the fair value of the Exchange Shares of $43.8 million and the carrying value of the $104.5 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes exchanged of $137.4 million. The Company filed a shelf registration statement in December 2020, which was declared effective providing for the resale of the Exchange Shares. Odeon Term Loan Facility. On February 15, 2021, Odeon entered into a new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million Odeon Term Loan Facility.

​ On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95 % Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2024 to Silver Lake and others. The Convertible Notes due 2024 would have matured on September 15, 2024, subject to earlier conversion by the holders thereof, repurchase by the Company at the option of the holders or redemption by the Company upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, as discussed below. On April 24, 2020, the Company entered into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the Convertible Notes due 2024 indenture, dated as of September 14, 2018. The Supplemental Indenture amended the debt covenant under the Convertible Notes due 2024 Indenture to permit the Company to issue the First Lien Notes due 2025, among other changes. On July 31, 2020, concurrently with the Exchange Offers to obtain the consent of the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Offers, the Company restructured the $600 million of Convertible Notes due 2024 issued in 2018 to Silver Lake and others pursuant to which the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 were extended to May 1, 2026 (the reset of the conversion price as discussed below was not extended) and a first-priority lien on the Collateral was granted to secure indebtedness thereunder. The Convertible Notes due 2026 are convertible at the option of the holders thereof on the same terms as the Convertible Notes due 2024. Upon maturity, the $600.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2026 will be payable in cash. The Company will pay interest in cash on the Convertible Notes due 2026 at 2.95 % per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15th and March 15th, commencing on September 15, 2020. On September 14, 2018, the Company bifurcated the conversion feature from the principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 as a derivative liability because (1) a conversion feature is not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument and the reset of the conversion price discussed in the following paragraph causes the conversion feature to not be considered indexed to the Company’s equity, (2) the conversion feature standing alone meets the definition of a derivative, and (3) the Convertible Notes due 2024 are not remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial derivative liability of $90.4 million is offset by a discount to the principal balance and is amortized to interest expense resulting in an effective rate of 5.98 % over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The Company also recorded deferred financing costs of approximately $13.6 million related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and will amortize those costs to interest expense under the effective interest method over the extended term of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The Company recorded interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $31.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $32.6 million and for the period from September 14, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $9.7 million. The derivative liability was remeasured at fair value each reporting period, a Level 3 fair value estimate, until the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as other expense or income. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the derivative liability as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the conversion feature is indexed to the Company’s equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company recorded in other expense (income) of $89.4 million, $(23.5) million and $(66.4) million, respectively, related to the derivative liability fair value adjustments for embedded conversion feature in the Convertible Notes due 2024. The if-converted value of the Convertible Notes due 2026 is less than the principal balance by approximately $505.8 million as of December 31, 2020 based on the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock of $2.12 per share. In addition, as a result of the adjustment to the conversion price, any future conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 will result in 5,666,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by Wanda being subject to forfeiture and retirement by the Company at no additional cost pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement (the “Stock Repurchase Agreement”) between the Company and Wanda discussed in Note 9 — Stockholders’ Equity. This cancellation agreement is a contingent call option for the forfeiture shares, which is a freestanding derivative measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which was a Level 3 estimate of fair value. The initial derivative asset of $10.7 million is offset by a credit to stockholders’ equity related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation. The forfeiture shares feature was not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes due 2026 host and it was bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative asset measured at fair value through earnings each reporting period until the conversion feature reset on September 14, 2020, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense or income. On September 14, 2020, the conversion price reset from $18.95 per share to $13.51 per share pursuant to the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the derivative asset as of September 14, 2020 was reclassified to permanent equity as the number of shares that will be cancelled on conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 are known. For the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, this resulted in other expense (income) of $19.6 million, $17.7 million, and $(45.0) million, respectively, related to the derivative asset fair value adjustment for contingent call option related to the Class B common stock purchase and cancellation agreement. Additionally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Company’s common stock (other than a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.20 per share until September 14, 2020 and $0.10 per share thereafter). Any Convertible Notes due 2026 that are converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes due 2026) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. The Company recorded an immaterial non-cash correction of $26.2 million recorded in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. The adjustment related to the Company correcting the valuation methodology applied to the derivative asset related to the cancellation agreement entered into on September 14, 2018, a Level 3 estimate of fair value for a complex instrument developed in consultation with a third party specialist. Upon conversion by a holder of the Convertible Notes due 2026, the Company shall deliver, at its election, either cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 52.7704 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes due 2026 (which represented an initial conversion price of $18.95), in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition to typical anti-dilution adjustments, because the then-applicable conversion price was greater than 120 % of the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the 10 days prior to the second anniversary of issuance on September 14, 2020 (the “Reset Conversion Price”), the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2026 was subject to a reset provision that adjusted the conversion price downward to such Reset Conversion Price. However, this conversion price reset provision was subject to a conversion price floor such that the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion would not exceed 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital after giving effect to the conversion. The volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on September 14, 2020 was $6.55 and, as a result, the conversion price reset provision was triggered. Effective as of September 14, 2020, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes due 2026 was adjusted to $13.51 , which represents the conversion price that would result in 30 % of the Company’s then outstanding fully-diluted share capital being issued upon conversion in full of the Convertible Notes due 2026. The conversion price reset provision was only applicable at September 14, 2020 and any future adjustments to the conversion price will be due to customary anti-dilution adjustments as set forth in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes due 2026. The holders of the Convertible Notes due 2026 may elect to convert the Convertible Notes due 2026 at any time and from time to time until September 15, 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the $600.0 million principal balance of the Convertible Notes due 2026 would be convertible into 44,422,860 , compared to 31,662,240 shares of Class A common stock before giving effect to the conversion price reset on September 14, 2020. See Note 17 — -Subsequent Events regarding the election to convert all $600.0 million of the Convertible Notes due 2026 into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. Odeon Revolving Credit Facility On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“Odeon Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited as arrangers. The lenders made available a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £ 100.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowed $120.8 million (the full availability net of standby letters of credit) under its £ 100.0 million Odeon Revolver ($136.3 million based on the foreign currency translation rate of 1.3628 on December 31, 2020). At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Odeon Revolver. The interest rate on each loan when drawn down under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility was 2.5 % plus IBOR (meaning LIBOR, EURIBOR, CIBOR or STIBOR as applicable) per annum. The undrawn commitment fee was 0.5 % of the undrawn amount per annum. All assets located in England and Wales have been pledged as collateral. On April 24, 2020, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited entered into an amendment to the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility with Lloyds Bank PLC as agent (the “Odeon Amendment”), pursuant to the requisite lenders thereunder granted a waiver of the maintenance covenant thereunder for the period from and after the effective date of the Odeon Amendment to and including the earlier of (a) March 31, 2021 and (b) the day immediately preceding the last day of the Relevant Period (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) during which Odeon Cinemas Group Limited has delivered a Financial Covenant Election (as defined in the Odeon Amendment) to the agent (the “Odeon Covenant Suspension Period”). During the Odeon Covenant Suspension Period, Odeon Cinemas Group Limited will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, make certain restricted payments including payment on shareholder loans, provided that cash payments of interest with respect to shareholder loans will be permitted. Additionally, lenders granted a waiver such that certain events or circumstances resulting from COVID-19 virus occurring prior to the Odeon Amendment and continuing will be deemed not to constitute an event of default under the Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 17 — -Subsequent Events for information regarding the new £ 140.0 million and € 296.0 million Odeon Term Loan Facility entered into on February 15, 2021, the net proceeds used to repay its existing revolving credit facility, and the minimum liquidity requirements. First Lien Notes due 2025 On April 24, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10.5 % First Lien Notes due 2025, in a private offering, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 24, 2020 (the “First Lien Notes Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent.

Stock-Based Compensation ​ 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ​ The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSU’s”), performance stock units (“PSU’s), stock awards, and cash performance awards. The maximum number of shares of Holdings’ common stock available for delivery pursuant to awards granted under the second amendment to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan is 15 million shares. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate number of shares of Holdings’ common stock available for grant was 8,520,193 shares. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $25.4 million, $4.4 million, and $14.9 million within general and administrative: other during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based compensation arrangements was approximately $15.2 million. The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately 1.5 years. Awards Granted in 2020, 2019, and 2018 ​ AMC’s Board of Directors approved awards of stock, RSU’s, and PSU’s to certain of the Company’s employees and directors under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. During years 2020, 2019, and 2018, the grant date fair value of these awards was based on the closing price of AMC’s stock on the date of grant, which ranged from $2.36 to $15.65 per share. A dividend equivalent for restricted stock units and performance stock units equal to the amount paid in respect of one share of Class A common stock underlying the unit began to accrue with respect to the unit on the date of grant. Such accrued dividend equivalents are paid to the holder upon vesting of the units. Each unit represents the right to receive one share of Class A common stock at a future date. The award agreements generally had the following features:

The Company recorded expense for these awards of $1.4 million and $2.4 million in general and administrative: other expense, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, based on achievement of the performance condition for 2019, and 2018.
============================================================


============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2020, PSU awards of 1,436,297 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2022. The PSUs will vest based on achieving 80 % to 120 % of the performance targets with the corresponding vested unit amount ranging from 50 % to 200 % (or 30 % to 200 % for PSU awards granted prior to year 2020). If the performance target is met at 100%, the PSU awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 will vest at 1,436,297 units in the aggregate. No PSUs will vest if Holdings does not achieve 80% of the three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow target. Additionally, unvested PSU’s shall be ratably forfeited upon termination of service prior to December 31, 2022. The vested PSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting which will occur upon certification of performance results by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
============================================================

During the year ended December 31, 2019, PSU awards of 730,167 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA, diluted earnings per share, and net profit performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, PSU awards of 653,669 were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2017, PSU awards were granted to certain members of management and executive officers with three-year cumulative net profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019. The performance conditions were not met as of December 31, 2019 and 100 % of the awards were forfeited. On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the PSUs for the awards granted in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The modification included separating the three-year cumulative performance targets into three separate year performance targets applicable to each tranche year. Due to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, the Board of Directors waived attainment of the 2020 tranche year performance targets and established a vesting level for such PSUs at 90 %. In addition, the service conditions were modified, and vesting is now subject to the participant’s continued employment through the end of the three-year cumulative period. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as an exchange of the original award, that was not expected to vest, for a new award. The Company measured the fair value of the new award on the modification date, October 30, 2020, because the Company determined that achieving performance thresholds were probable for certain tranche awards. The Company recorded approximately $1.2 million, $(5.8) million, and $5.8 million of expense (credit) related to PSUs in general and administrative: other expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Company determined that achieving the PSU performance thresholds was improbable and reversed previously recorded expense of $5.8 million on these units during the year ended December 31, 2019.

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement: During the year ended December 31, 2019, a PSU market condition award of 300,000 was granted to an executive officer of the Company that would vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Class A common stock. This award was subsequently cancelled and replaced with the PSU market condition award granted on February 26, 2020.
============================================================

On February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020, special performance stock unit awards (“SPSUs”), totaling 3,570,000 units were granted to certain executive officers that will vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company’s Class common stock. The SPSUs are eligible to vest in tranches contingent upon (i) the attainment of certain 20 trading day volume weighted average closing prices and (ii) fulfillment of the three-year service requirement from the date of grant. The vested SPSUs will be settled within 30 days of vesting. Any unvested SPSUs remaining after 10 years will be forfeited. If service is terminated prior to the three year anniversary from the date of grant, unvested SPSUs shall be forfeited. The target prices and vesting tranches are set forth in the table below: ​

============================================================

============================================================

​ The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the SPSUs. This model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the SPSUs: ​

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assumptions Expected stock price volatility ​ 45.0 % Expected dividend yield ​ 2.02 % and 2.44 % Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.33 % and 0.92 % Grant-date stock price ​ $5.93 and $4.92
============================================================

​ The expected stock price volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period equivalent to the derived service period. The expected dividend yield is based on annual expected dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate was based on the treasury yield rates as of the date of grant for a period equivalent to the performance measurement period. The fair value of each SPSU is amortized over the requisite or derived service period, which is up to 6.4 years. The SPSUs granted on February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020 have a grant date fair value of approximately $12.2 million. On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the SPSUs for the awards. Each SPSU award agreement was amended as follows:

============================================================
FINANCIAL TABLE
============================================================
● The stock price thresholds (ranging from $12 to $24) and service requirement for tranches 1 through 4 of the SPSUs were eliminated and such SPSUs vested on October 30, 2020;

============================================================

============================================================
● The service requirement for tranches 5 and 6 was shortened to end on October 30, 2021.
============================================================

As a result of the SPSU modification of market conditions, the incremental fair value amount assigned to the grant date fair value was approximately $7.3 million in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a total of $14.0 million related to SPSUs in general and administrative: other expense.

​ ​ NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 for domestic operations. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods on a federal, state and foreign jurisdiction basis. The Company conducts its evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. motion picture and broader economy, among others. During the first quarter of 2020, the severe impact of COVID-19 on operations in Germany and Spain caused the Company to conclude the realizability of deferred tax assets held in those jurisdictions does not meet the more likely than not standard. As such, a charge of $33.1 million and $40.1 million was recorded for Germany and Spain, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, several other international jurisdictions carried valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets at the beginning of 2020. Cancellation of Debt Income. On July 31, 2020, the Company consummated its previously announced private offers to exchange its Existing Subordinated Notes for newly issued Second Lien Notes due 2026. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. For US tax purposes the Company is required to recognize CODI on the difference between the face value of debt exchanged and the fair market value of the new debt issued. The Company has determined that it should recognize an estimated $1.2 billion of CODI for tax purposes. IRS §108 provides relief from recognizing the CODI as current taxable income to the extent that the tax paying legal entity is insolvent as defined by the US Tax Code. The Company currently estimates that the level of its insolvency at July 31, 2020 exceeds the indicated amount of CODI resulting from the debt exchange. To the extent that the entity is insolvent, rather than recognize current taxable income, the entity may reduce its tax attributes including net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits, depreciable assets, investment in subsidiaries and other investments in the amount of the excluded CODI. For purposes of determining the current and deferred tax provision, and uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company estimated approximately $1.2 billion of its net operating losses have been eliminated as a result of tax attribute reduction. The actual effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was (1.3)%. The Company’s consolidated tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, foreign tax rate differences, federal and state tax credits, partially offset by state income taxes, permanent differences related to goodwill impairments, interest, compensation, and other discrete items. No tax impact was recorded on the $2,306.4 million goodwill impairment charge incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the portion impaired was permanently non-deductible. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $40.2 million and net deferred tax assets of $24.1 million, respectively. Cares Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property, as well as loans to certain qualifying businesses. The Company continues to examine the impacts that the CARES Act may have on its business. While the Company may take advantage of certain CARES Act’s cash deferral provisions, many of the provisions are not applicable to the Company. Additionally, as of the date of this filing, the Company has not participated in CARES Act loans. The income tax provision (benefit) reflected in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following components: ​

(1) The 2020 valuation allowance primarily relates to the Company’s increase in the current year’s federal, state and international net operating losses, for which no benefit has been recognized, and the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce the previously recognized benefit of deferred tax assets in Germany and Spain, which an expense of $73.2 million has been recognized.

(2) Primarily relates to amounts resulting from the Company’s changes in deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowance that are not related to income statement activity as well as amounts charged to other comprehensive income. In 2019, this includes $(28.6) million of valuation allowance associated with the sale of the Austria theatres.

The Company has federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $686.5 million. Approximately $284.6 million will begin to expire in 2021, and will completely expire in 2036, and will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $401.9 million can be used indefinitely. The Company’s foreign net operating losses of $859.7 million can be used indefinitely except for approximately $9.3 million, which will expire in various amounts between years 2022 and 2035. The Company also has state income tax loss carryforwards of $1,024.6 million. Approximately $735.3 million may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years . Approximately $289.3 million can be used indefinitely. A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: ​

​ The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. No interest expense or penalties related to federal uncertain tax positions have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The Company analyzed and reviewed the remaining state uncertain tax positions to determine the necessity of accruing interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million of interest expense and $0.5 million of penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized no interest expense or penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for state uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $6.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $7.2 million of its unrecognized tax positions related to state taxes may be recognized by the end of 2021 as a result of settlements or the expiration of statute of limitations. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. An IRS examination of the tax year March 29, 2012 is currently ongoing. Generally, tax years beginning after December 31, 2002 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for tax years ended December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2020, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforward and other tax attributes became subject to the Section 382 ownership change limitation due to changes in our stock ownership on January 29, 2021. Accordingly, our ability to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be significantly limited. See Note 17 — Subsequent Events for further information regarding change in stock ownership. ​ ​ ​ NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. On January 12, 2018 and January 19, 2018, two putative federal securities class actions, captioned Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00299-AJN (the “Hawaii Action”), and Nichols v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-00510-AJN (the “Nichols Action,” and together with the Hawaii Action, the “Actions”), respectively, were filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Actions, which name certain of the Company’s officers and directors and, in the case of the Hawaii Action, the underwriters of the Company’s February 8, 2017 secondary public offering, as defendants, assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to alleged material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for the secondary public offering and in certain other public disclosures. On May 30, 2018, the court consolidated the Actions. On January 22, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint. On September 23, 2019, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. On March 2, 2020, plaintiffs moved to certify the purported class. The motion was fully briefed on September 21, 2020. On May 21, 2018, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 2:18-cv-02262-JAR-TJJ (the “Gantulga Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas. The Gantulga Action, which was filed on behalf of the Company, asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions. On October 12, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the court granted on October 15, 2018. When the action was transferred to the Southern District of New York, it was re-captioned Gantulga v. Aron, et al. , Case No. 1:18-cv-10007-AJN. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on December 17, 2018. On October 2, 2019, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Kenna v. Aron , et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-09148-AJN (the “Kenna Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on October 17, 2019. On April 20, 2020, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The Kenna Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 21D of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions and the Gantulga Action. The action remains stayed. On March 20, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Manuel v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02456-AJN (the “Manuel Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Manuel Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 21D, and 29(b) of the Exchange Act and for breaches of fiduciary duty based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, and the Kenna Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which the court granted on May 18, 2020. On April 7, 2020, a stockholder derivative complaint, captioned Dinkevich v. Aron, et al ., Case No. 1:20-cv-02870-AJN (the “Dinkevich Action”), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Dinkevich Action asserts the same claims as the Manuel Action based on allegations substantially similar to the Actions, the Gantulga Action, the Kenna Action, and the Manuel Action. The parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the action, which was granted on June 25, 2020. On December 31, 2019, the Company received a stockholder litigation demand, requesting that the Board investigate the allegations in the Actions and pursue claims on the Company’s behalf based on those allegations. On May 5, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On July 15, 2020, the Company received a second stockholder litigation demand requesting substantially the same action as the stockholder demand it received on December 31, 2019. On September 23, 2020, the Board determined not to pursue the claims sought in the demand at this time. On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. , et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of common stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On January 8, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the court recommending that the court dismiss all of the claims asserted in the Lao Action, and moved to dismiss all of the claims in the Lao Action. The court has not yet ruled on the Special Litigation Committee’s motion to dismiss. The Company remains contingently liable for lease payments under certain leases of theatres that it previously divested, in the event that such assignees are unable to fulfill their future lease payment obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $15.0 million, in estimated credit losses related to contingent lease guarantees in other expense. The Company applied a probability weighted approach for the estimation of credit loss reserve for contingent lease guarantees expected to be funded over the lease term using the discounted cash flow method. The Company a contingent lease liability of $30.2 million recorded in other long term liabilities.

The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ​

Valuation Techniques. The Company’s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes due 2024 with a conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument and a stock purchase and cancellation agreement that gave rise to a derivative asset (See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations). The derivative features have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo simulation approach consists of simulated common stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Convertible Notes and to September 14, 2020 for the contingent call option for forfeiture shares. Increases or decreases in the Company’s share price, the volatility of the share price, the passage of time, risk-free interest rate, discount yield, and dividend yield will all impact the value of the derivative instruments. The Company re-values the derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and any changes are recorded in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. The following fair value hierarchy tables summarize the Company’s assets that were written down to their fair value on a nonrecurring basis: ​

​ Valuation Techniques. There were a number of estimates and significant judgments that were made by management in performing these impairment evaluations. Such judgments and estimates include estimates of future revenues, cash flows, rent relief, cost savings, capital expenditures, and the cost of capital, among others. Attendance is expected to be below historical levels following the full reopening of our circuit and studios have shifted new film releases or moved them to the home video market, and movie release dates may continue to move in the future. The Company believes it used reasonable and appropriate business judgments. At December 31, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 11.0 % and 12.5 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 % for both of the reporting units. At September 30, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 12.0 % and 13.0 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 1.0 % for both of the reporting units. At March 31, 2020, the Company used weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) input for the Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units of 11.5 % and 13.0 %, respectively, and a long-term growth rate input of 2.0 % for both of the reporting units. To estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names, we employed a derivation of the Income Approach known as the Royalty Savings Method. The Royalty Savings Method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. At December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, we applied royalty rates of 0.5 % for AMC and Odeon trade names and 1.0 % for Nordic to the related theatre revenues on an after-tax basis using effective tax rates. At December 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.0 % for AMC and 13.5 % for Odeon and Nordic, at September 30, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 13.0 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic, and at March 31, 2020, related cash flows were discounted at 12.5 % for AMC and 14.0 % for Odeon and Nordic. There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate discount rates to be used in determining fair value, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. These estimates determine whether impairments have been incurred and quantify the amount of any related impairment charge. See Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information. Other Fair Value Measurement Disclosures. The following table summarizes the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value: ​

​ Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for Level 2 inputs. The Level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. On September 14, 2018, the Company issued $600.0 million of Convertible Notes due 2024. These notes were issued by private placement, as such there is no observable market for these convertible notes (now the Convertible Notes due 2026). The Company valued these notes at principal value less a discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. See Note 8 — Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. ​ ​ NOTE 13—OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company reports information about operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting, which requires financial information to be reported based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and evaluating performance. The Company has identified two reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia. On August 28, 2020, the Company divested of 49 % of its interest in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania operations. The Company completed the 100% divestiture of Latvia during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 1 — The Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information on the Baltics theatre sale agreement. Operations located in Austria were sold during the first quarter of 2019. Each segment’s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, AMC Stubs ® membership fees and other loyalty programs, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments. Below is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: ​

(1) The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets and any cash distributions of earnings from its other equity method investees. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with how Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Company’s debt indentures.

============================================================

​ Vested RSUs, PSUs, and SPSUs have dividend rights identical to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, unvested RSUs of 1,131,333 , 1,377,992 , and 210,558 , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would be anti-dilutive. Unvested PSUs and SPSUs are subject to performance and market conditions, respectively, and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. Unvested PSUs of 649,209 , 477,630 and 364,269 at the minimum performance targets for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and unvested SPSUs of 578,328 at the minimum market condition for the year ended December 31, 2020, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or they would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes that were issued on September 14, 2018. The Company has not adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to eliminate the interest expense of $31.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and the loss (gain) for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes of $89.4 million and $(23.5) million, respectively, in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. The Company has not included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 35.5 million and 31.7 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the effects would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adjusted net earnings to eliminate the interest expense and the (gain) for the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes due 2026 of $9.7 million and $(66.4) million, respectively, in the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has included in diluted weighted average shares approximately 9.5 million shares issuable upon conversion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the effects were dilutive. Based on the current conversion price of $13.51 per share, the Convertible Notes are convertible into 44,422,860 Class A common shares. ​ ​ NOTE 16—SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED) ​ ​
